Sample guides for <u>illustrative purposes only</u> are available <a href="sampleguides/"><b>here</b></a>.<br><br>It is also capable of performing many other Wii\vWii hacking functions like setting up a usb-loader and creating an emulated NAND. ModMii was also the very first official installer for the widely adopted d2x cIOS.<br><br> Even if your Wii's SD Card reader is broken or you just don't have an SD Card, you can use a Hard Drive formatted as FAT32 in place of an SD Card to complete the majority of ModMii's functions (SD Card notably required for Bootmii and making a NAND backup). In fact ModMii can help users softmod a Wii even without an SD Card or Hard Drive (as long as it has internet), but unless one or the other is eventually incorporated there probably isn't much point.<br><br>ModMii only works on Windows, and ModMii v8.0.0 and higher requires 64-bit Windows 8.1 or later. If you do not have a Windows PC and are unable to run ModMii you can try running Windows in a virtual machine or just use <a href="https://wii.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">wii.hacks.guide</a> or <a href="https://wiiu.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">wiiu.hacks.guide</a> instead.<br><br>The video below describes some of ModMii's many features; however note that it was created before WiiU & vWii support was added in v8.0.0.<br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GMz_R18Z5oQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br> <font color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>What can ModMii do?</b></font><br><ul style=align="left" type="disc"><li>Softmod any Wii, WiiU or vWii<li>Generate custom guides depending on the options that you select<li>Update only your outdated softmods based on a SysCheck log from your Wii or vWii<li>Check for updates to your Wii\vWii\WiiU homebrew<li>Softmod Wii and vWii completely offline without requiring internet on the console<li>Safely upgrade or downgrade your Wii System Menu to 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 protecting against 003 bricks<li>Able to build a custom easy to follow guide to setting up a USB-Loader (including how to format/partition your external hard drive)<li>Install SNEEK (Wii only), build emulated NANDs (Wii & vWii) and Batch Extract Wii/Gamecube Games for use with SNEEK+DI or UNEEK+DI<li>Load NEEK on a Wii without softmodding it using the Abstinence Wizard (i.e. Non-permanent Wii Hacks)<li>Region Change Your Wii<li>Download\build IOS & cIOS WADs, Official Wii Channels, System Menus, Homebrew\apps, etc.<li>Install patched IOSs without a wifi connection on your Wii\vWii<li>Customize Bootmii, Wad Manager and MMM config files to adjust their start-up settings<li>Build Wii\vWii\Wii-Mini System Menu Themes<li>HackMii Solutions Wizard for Wii's experiencing an upside-down homebrew channel or HackMii Installer No Vulnerable IOS problems<li>Advanced Custom Downloads Feature to easily patch and change the slot/version of IOSs/cIOSs.

Some additional files were also added to ModMii's File Cleanup list.<li>ModMii Classic's Advanced Downloads page has been drastically changed\improved. Users can now construct multiple different versions of d2x cIOSs in the same download queue. Adding advanced cIOS downloads to a queue is much faster with less prompts than before. Added option to Remove Last Advanced Download from queue in case you make a mistake. Advanced cIOS download slots are now limited to a range of 200-253; this means that there is zero risk of bricking from any of ModMii's Advanced Downloads (EXCEPT User-Defined Custom Downloads, which can still be dangerous if you do not know what you are doing).<ul><li>Download queues are loaded differently for queues built using modmii 8.0.0 or lower vs 8.0.1+. 8.0.1+ queues will works as you would expect and support multiple versions of d2x in the same queue. Old queues 8.0.0 or lower (built for a single version of d2x) will continue to be adjusted to sync with the version of d2x selected in ModMii's options.<li>All IOSs have been removed from the Advanced Downloads page; these can still be retrieved using ModMii's User-Defined Custom Download option.</ul><li>When completing a wizard that includes d2x cIOSs ModMii will now prompt users if they want to switch to the latest "recommended" d2x cIOS instead of the "bundled" cIOS. The Recommended version of d2x can now be toggled by entering "R" in the d2x options page. Restoring default settings will also enable the recommended d2x version if it differs from the bundled version and notify the user accordingly.<ul><li>ModMii will only check for other d2x versions available online once per session. This makes changing d2x versions multiple times in a single session much faster.<li>At startup, but no more than once per day, ModMii will silently check\confirm the latest "recommended" d2x cIOS version.</ul><li>ModMii's Advanced Downloads Forwarder Builder can now also create hidden channel forwarder WADs (not applicable for for Channel ID Forwarder types as this would be redundant). Particularly useful for WiiU users booting Wii homebrew or games directly from WUHB forwarders but don't want channels to be visible or take up space in the Wii menu.<li>Enhanced ModMii's App Launcher with support for wuhb, rpx and wps files to be able to wiiload these file types from your PC to your WiiU via the internet (requires Wiiload Plugin).<li>Added Wiiload & FTPiiU plugins for WiiU\Aroma to Download Page 5 and to App Updater checks.<li>Updated bundled version of d2x cIOS to <a href="https://github.com/wiidev/d2x-cios/releases/tag/d2x-v11-beta3" target="_blank">v11 beta3</a>.</ul><ul><li>See <a href="changelog.html#8.0.1" target="_blank">full 8.0.1 changelog</a> for more information.</ul></div><br><a href="changelog.html" target="_blank"><font size="5">Click here to view the full changelog</font></a></center><br><p style="text-align:center"><a href="donations.html"><img src="Images/donate.png" height="95" width="109" border="0"></a></p></body> </html><!-- Ends the HTML above -->
