Sample guides for <u>illustrative purposes only</u> are available <a href="sampleguides/"><b>here</b></a>.<br><br>It is also capable of performing many other Wii\vWii hacking functions like setting up a usb-loader and creating an emulated NAND. ModMii was also the very first official installer for the widely adopted d2x cIOS.<br><br> Even if your Wii's SD Card reader is broken or you just don't have an SD Card, you can use a Hard Drive formatted as FAT32 in place of an SD Card to complete the majority of ModMii's functions (SD Card notably required for Bootmii and making a NAND backup). In fact ModMii can help users softmod a Wii even without an SD Card or Hard Drive (as long as it has internet), but unless one or the other is eventually incorporated there probably isn't much point.<br><br>ModMii only works on Windows, and ModMii v8.0.0 and higher requires 64-bit Windows 8.1 or later. If you do not have a Windows PC and are unable to run ModMii you can try running Windows in a virtual machine or just use <a href="https://wii.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">wii.hacks.guide</a> or <a href="https://wiiu.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">wiiu.hacks.guide</a> instead.<br><br>The video below describes some of ModMii's many features; however note that it was created before WiiU & vWii support was added in v8.0.0.<br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GMz_R18Z5oQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br> <font color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>What can ModMii do?</b></font><br><ul style=align="left" type="disc"><li>Softmod any Wii, WiiU or vWii<li>Generate custom guides depending on the options that you select<li>Update only your outdated softmods based on a SysCheck log from your Wii or vWii<li>Check for updates to your Wii\vWii\WiiU homebrew<li>Softmod Wii and vWii completely offline without requiring internet on the console<li>Safely upgrade or downgrade your Wii System Menu to 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 protecting against 003 bricks<li>Able to build a custom easy to follow guide to setting up a USB-Loader (including how to format/partition your external hard drive)<li>Install SNEEK (Wii only), build emulated NANDs (Wii & vWii) and Batch Extract Wii/Gamecube Games for use with SNEEK+DI or UNEEK+DI<li>Load NEEK on a Wii without softmodding it using the Abstinence Wizard (i.e. Non-permanent Wii Hacks)<li>Region Change Your Wii<li>Download\build IOS & cIOS WADs, Official Wii Channels, System Menus, Homebrew\apps, etc.<li>Install patched IOSs without a wifi connection on your Wii\vWii<li>Customize Bootmii, Wad Manager and MMM config files to adjust their start-up settings<li>Build Wii\vWii\Wii-Mini System Menu Themes<li>HackMii Solutions Wizard for Wii's experiencing an upside-down homebrew channel or HackMii Installer No Vulnerable IOS problems<li>Advanced Custom Downloads Feature to easily patch and change the slot/version of IOSs/cIOSs.

ARCME v1.0.7 also added (basic) GameCube controller support. Thanks thepikachugamer!<li>Str2hax steps adjusted to direct users to only change primary DNS. Secondary DNS was just sitting there doing nothing anyway.<li>Enhanced checks for supported d2x cIOS base IOSs, now dynamically determined from ciosmaps.xml instead of hardcoded. This anticipates future d2x releases likely dropping bases other than 38, 56, 57, and 58. Thanks blackb0x for the heads up!<li>Added TinyWiiBackupManager to Download Page 5 and Uninstaller. Thanks mq1!<li>Bundled a new version of WiiPy with EmuNAND-related fixes. It now creates sys\cert.sys if missing when installing content to EmuNANDs. Previously some games wouldn't boot in USB Loaders on freshly created EmuNAND unless they had first been loaded in neek\Dolphin to build the missing files. ModMii\WiiPy can now correct any such EmuNAND automatically by installing any WAD(s) to it. Thanks NinjaCheetah!<li>Fixed a harmless bug in the main ModMii Wizard where a new System Menu version sometimes wasn't downloaded. This only occurred if changing Wii System Menu versions and selecting "Default theme". Choosing "No, do not change the theme" worked as expected. Previously, if "Default theme" was selected, a stock theme and csminstaller was also unnecessarily downloaded and referenced in the generated guide.<li>Fixed minor issue where Compat Title Installer was not being downloaded when modding WiiU and vWii simultaneously via the ModMii Wizard. This only affected users modding both systems in the same run and worked fine when modding only WiiU or only vWii.<li>Fixed WiiLinkPatcher download, which had been inadvertently grabbing the Windows ARM version since v2.1.0.<li>Fixed Nintendont update checks — they were too strong with the don’t. ModMii now compensates for Nintendont's hosted meta.xml, which never updates (the app updates it at run-time). ModMii previously kept whatever version it initially downloaded since its "Newer than 4.431" version always matched the latest meta.xml.<li>Fixed minor issue with version parsing for apps with more than 3 components (e.g. abuse 0.8.684.2). Only "abuse" was affected and would not update if an older version was detected.<li>Fixed minor bug where ModMii Classic would exit if run for the first time AND run as Administrator. Launching without admin rights (or launching ModMii Skin in any mode) avoided the issue. Turns out ModMii couldn’t handle unlimited power.<li>Updated ModMii.exe launcher. The previous version worked for almost everyone but now it should work in all cases. Users can still run \Support\ModMii.bat if any issues persist.<li>Enhanced HTML guide opening to better support other languages and special characters in destination paths. This previously caused a harmless REG_SV error for French users (and possibly others). ModMii still opens HTML guides using the default web browser in case users have not set HTML file associations. Thanks Julienraptor01 for the assist!<li>Fixed a minor bug where ModMii would exit when modifying a WAD with a title ID containing non-printable characters. Also fixed harmless onscreen errors when failing to detect the NandLoader used for rare or unusual WADs.<li>So many small things were fixed that ModMii is now 7% more polite and 12% less likely to side with Skynet.<li>Other minor changes and enhancements.</ul></div><br><a href="changelog.html" target="_blank"><font size="5">Click here to view the full changelog</font></a></center><br><p style="text-align:center"><a href="donations.html"><img src="Images/donate.png" height="95" width="109" border="0"></a></p></body> </html><!-- Ends the HTML above -->
