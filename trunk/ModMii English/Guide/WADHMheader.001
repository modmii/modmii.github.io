In Multi-Mod Manager's main menu, go down to select "WAD Manager".<br>
<br>
If you cannot load your SD card, select "Load another IOS", then select IOS36.<br>
If the Wii was previously softmodded, try loading cIOS250 (or others like 202,222,223,224,236,249).<br>
<br>
Install the following WADs from the WAD folder (this list of WADs is unique to the information you provided ModMii).<br>
Be careful not to install any additional WADs that may have been previously saved in this folder (they may be safe, but I cannot say for sure).<br>
<br>
Mark each of the following WADs for installation by navigating to each WAD and hitting "+"<br>
Alternatively, you can hold "+" for 2 seconds to select all the WADs in the folder.<br>
After you've marked all the WADs listed below, press 'A' twice to install them.<br>
<br>
If any files fail to install properly, they will remain marked for installation, so just retry installing those files.<br>
