You can use this program to manage/transfer your electronic backups of Wii Games.<br>
It is very simple to use, but a detailed tutorial on using Wii Backup Manager can be found here: <a href="http://www.sites.google.com/site/completesg/backup-launchers/iso/wbfs-managers/wii-backup-manager" target="_blank">www.sites.google.com/site/completesg/backup-launchers/iso/wbfs-managers/wii-backup-manager</a><br>

<b>Note:</b> Original Wii Discs cannot be read/copied using a computer (unless you have one of the rare LG Drives that is capable of doing so).<br>
