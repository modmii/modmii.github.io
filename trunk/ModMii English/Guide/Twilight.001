Requirements: A copy of "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess", a standard SD card (will not work with an SDHC card), and a nunchuck.<br>
<ol type="A"><li>Load the Twilight Princess game at least once (otherwise you won't be able to copy over the hack).</li>
<li>Delete or move\backup your personal "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess" save file before copying the files to your SD Card.</li>
<li>Copy the ModMii files to the root of your SD card (if you haven’t already) and insert it into your Wii.</li>
<li>Go into Wii Options - Data Management - Save Data - Wii - SD Card then copy over the "Twilight Hack" save that corresponds to your game region.</li>
<b>Note for US users:</b> Look at the bottom of the game disc first. If it has RVL-RZDE-0A-2 USA in its inner ring, you'll have to load TwilightHack2 in a later step. If it says something else, load TwilightHack0.
<li>Insert the The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess disc and run the game.</li>
<li>On the title screen of the game, press A and B to go to the main menu.</li>
<li>Now load the twilight hack save file.<br>
<b>Note:</b> If you accidentally load the wrong file and continue with the hack, the game will freeze but do not panic, just hold down the power button on your Wii console for 5 seconds to turn it off, then turn it back on, and start over.</li>
<li>The game will start like normal. To execute the hack, talk to the first character you see, or try to leave the room.</li></ol>
