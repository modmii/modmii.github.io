<b>Important notes on default settings:</b><br>
Two potentially dangerous features have been locked:<br>
<ul>
<li>The ability to remove/delete games</li>
<li>The ability to format a hard drive</li>
</ul>
To unlock these features, while in the configurable USB-Loader menu, hold "1" for 5 seconds, then enter the password to unlock these features. The password is "AAAA", you can change the password/settings by using the Configurator for Configurable USB-Loader. Hold "1" again for 5 seconds to lock the USB-Loader again (or it will lock automatically again once you exit the USB-Loader).<br>
