		<li>To manually "install" apps, download your homebrew and you should find a boot.dol (or boot.elf) file and possibly an icon.png and meta.xml.
		<li>For the HBC to read your SD/USB correctly, your card must be structured SD+USB:/apps/application name/boot.dol\elf
		<li>Some apps require a meta.xml be saved in the same place as the boot.dol\elf to work properly (icon.png is always optional).
		<li>If you have a dol or elf file not named "boot", rename it boot.dol\elf, otherwise it will not be recognized by the HBC (not required if using Priiloader to install a file).

Note that some channels may not yet be updated for vWii; simply open them using ModMii to edit the NandLoader to make them vWii compatible.

<li>Get a new <a href="https://wii.hacks.guide/themes.html" target="_blank">theme for your vWii Menu</a>! Confirm you have Priiloader installed before installing themes, then open mym themes\files using ModMii or ThemeMii Mod to convert them to csm files for your specific system menu version. Or check out the huge library of themes available at <a href="https://www.wiithemer.org" target="_blank">www.wiithemer.org</a>, a website that also converts MYMs to CSMs for you on the fly. CSM files can then be installed to your Wii using csm-installer. ThemeMii Mod and csm-installer are both available on ModMii Classic's Download Pages.
<li>"Expand" your vWii's internal memory for more WiiWare and Virtual Console games by having it load the System Menu from external storage instead. Use ModMii's Emulated NAND builder to get started.
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>You can also use your vWii's nand.bin or slccmpt.bin backup as an Emulated NAND. To extract the files from a nand.bin or slccmpt.bin to use as an Emulated NAND, simply open the file using ModMii. If ModMii prompts you to share keys to repair the nand provide it with your keys.bin or opt.bin backup.
	<li>Alternatively, you can dump your vWii's NAND to use as an Emulated NAND using USB Loader GX's features menu.
	</ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/Naim2000/csm-installer/releases" target="_blank">csm-installer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/ww-43db-patcher" target="_blank">ww-43db-patcher</a> from ModMii Classic's Download Page 2 can be used to patch the WiiWare 4:3 aspect ratio database (43DB) to enable a 16:9 aspect ratio in Everybody Votes Channel and Check Mii Out Channels. However, if you installed any vWii theme built using ModMii (even the Default theme) this patch has already been applied.
