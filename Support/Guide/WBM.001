<i>Wii Backup Manager (WBM) is a Windows program to help transfer Wii games to and from hard drives and SD cards.<br>It can also download game covers, list your games, identify what games are missing between devices, and more.</i><br>
<br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>You can use this program to manage/transfer your backup copies of Wii Games (.WBFS/.ISO/.CISO).
<li>It is very simple to use, but a detailed tutorial on using Wii Backup Manager can be found <a href="https://wii.hacks.guide/wii-backups#using-wii-backup-manager" target="_blank">here</a>.

	<li>Below is a single WBFS example, and a split WBFS example. A WBFS file needs to be split if it is over 4GB and your storage device is formatted as FAT32. During transfer operations WBM can automatically split games and set up the directory structure for you.<br>

<font size="5"><b>NKit Processing App</b></font><br>
<i>NKit is a Nintendo ToolKit that can Recover and Preserve Wii and GameCube disc images.</i><br><br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>Practically speaking you will only need this app if you encounter an "NKit.iso" or "NKit.gcz" game backup, which are not supported by WBM or GCBM.
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>Usually these files have NKit in their names, but if WBM or GCBM cannot handle a backup it may be an unlabelled NKit backup.
	</ul>
<br>
<li><b>How to use the NKit Processing App to convert NKit backups to ISO</b>

	<ol type="A">
	<li>Drag and drop source file(s) onto the NKit Processing App window.
	<li>Select "Convert to ISO" Mode.
	<li>Click "Process".
	<li>When finished, the converted game will be saved to: ..\NKit\Processed\Wii_MatchFail\
