Requirements: <=2GB SD Card; larger SDHC and SDXC also work if on System Menu 4.0 or higher. Works on System Menus 3.0 to 4.3. Can launch both dols and elfs. Works on Wii only.<br>
<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the "Messageboard" on your Wii and navigate to Yesterday.
<li>Click on the envelope with the pink bomb icon to launch the boot.elf/dol file saved on the root of your SD Card.
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you cannot find the mailbox bomb under "Yesterday" check that your Wii's date setting is correct.
	<li>If you click the envelope and are returned to the Wii Menu double check that your SD Card's lock switch is disabled and try again.
	<li>If you have difficulty with this exploit use "str2hax" instead by clicking the str2hax button above, or try reformatting your SD Card, or a different SD Card altogether.
	</ul>
</ol>

<i>Fun Fact! There are two tools that are able to construct this exploit. ModMii uses Wilbrand, which does not require an internet connection to construct its "Mailbox Bomb". This is functionally the same as "LetterBomb" that can be constructed and downloaded from please.hackmii.com.</i><br>
