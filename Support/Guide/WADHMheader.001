<i>YAWM ModMii Edition stands for Yet Another Wad Manager ModMii Edition (aka yawmME). A WAD Manager will allow you to install "WADs" containing things like updates and other content for your console, like IOSs, custom IOSs (or cIOSs), or other downloadable content, which can be all packed into WADs and installed to your console. Think of a WAD like a zip file but for the Wii.</i><br>
<br>

WARNINGS: Do not unplug the console when installing WADs. WADs can also be <u>un</u>installed, and if you're not careful you can brick your console by uninstalling or even installing the wrong WAD. The WAD Manager you're using, YAWM ModMii Edition, has some extra brick protection built in to restrict someone from doing catastrophic things like uninstalling any System Menu WAD, or required System Menu IOS, or a dozen other things which could potentially result in a brick if you don't know what you're doing. Stick to your ModMii guide and you'll be fine.<br>

<i>Fun Fact! I mentioned IOSs and cIOSs before, "the Wii console uses the 'IOS' system to communicate with the hardware, it's like a driver (compared to Windows). It contains information and communication tools (like how to access the Disc drive, how to access USB, read the savegames data stored on internal memory, etc.)" ~Cyan. If you're curious to learn more about IOSs or cIOSs, a thorough explanation can be found in <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/d2xl-cios-a-fork-of-davebaols-d2x-cios.558581/#post-8968173" target="_blank">Cyan's IOS Explanation post</a>.</i><br>

<li><b>From YAWM ModMii Edition's main menu choose your source device using left and right, most likely "Wii SD Slot", and Press <kbd>A</kbd></b>.

<li><b>Install the <u>guidewadcountplaceholder WADs</u> listed below</b>.<br>

	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>Be careful not to install any additional WADs that may have been previously saved in this folder (they may be safe, but I cannot say for sure).
	<li><i>Fun Fact! Installing a clean/unpatched version of IOS58 should be enough to make the HackMii Installer happy, but we're (re)installing a few extra IOSs that the HackMii Installer is known to play nicely with just in case.</i>
