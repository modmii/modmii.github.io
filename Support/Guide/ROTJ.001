Requirements: A copy of "LEGO Star Wars", a standard SD card (will not work with an SDHC or SDXC card), and a nunchuck. Does not work on Korean System Menus. Can launch elfs but not dols. Works on Wii and vWii.<br>
<br>
<ol type="A"><li>Load the LEGO Star Wars game at least once (otherwise you won't be able to copy over the hack).</li>
<li>Delete or move\backup your personal "LEGO Star Wars" save file.</li>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you want to move\copy your save data to the same SD card with your ModMii files, first rename the SD:\private folder containing the exploit to something else. Then copy your save from the console to your SD Card and backup the new private folder with your save. Finally rename the original exploit folder back to SD:\private and reinsert the SD Card into your console before continuing to the next step. At the end of this guide you can restore the backup you made.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Go into Wii Options - Data Management - Save Data - Wii - SD Card then copy over the "LEGO Star Wars" save that corresponds to your region.</li>
<li>Start the LEGO Star Wars. Load the first save slot (on the left, at 0.0 percent).</li>
<li>As soon as the level loads, go to the bar on the right and you'll see two characters floating in blue tanks.</li>
<li>Choose the character named "Return of Jodi" and press the <kbd>A</kbd> button to launch the exploit and load your homebrew application.</li></ol>
