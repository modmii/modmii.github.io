<li>Delete or move\backup your personal "Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World" save file.</li>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you want to move\copy your save data to the same SD card with your ModMii files, first rename the SD:\private folder containing the exploit to something else. Then copy your save from the console to your SD Card and backup the new private folder with your save. Finally rename the original exploit folder back to SD:\private and reinsert the SD Card into your console before continuing to the next step. At the end of this guide you can restore the backup you made.</li>
