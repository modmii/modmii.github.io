<!---------------------------------SOFTMOD NOTES BELOW----------------------------------->
<li>An SD Card is recommended, but not necessary, to <u>fully</u> softmod your console.
<li>Check if your SD Card has a lock switch and make sure it's disabled.</li>
<li>If you get errors during any of the steps try reformatting your SD Card (or HDD) as FAT32.</li>
<li>If your Wii ever freezes, hold the power button on the Wii for 5 seconds to power it off then try again.</li>
<li>Never uninstall a System Menu or IOS.</li>
<li>When updating your softmod you should always overwrite old mods by installing new ones, do <u>not</u> try to "Delete everything" or "Start from scratch".</li>
<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>To update your mods in the future you can use the ModMii Wizard as if it was your first time, or even better, update only what's outdated using ModMii's Syscheck Updater Wizard and reduce the number of steps!</li>
</ul>
<li>If you accept an official Nintendo update after modding the Wii, you may lose some of your modifications and have to reinstall them.</li>
<li>Do not install untested WADs/themes without Priiloader, Bootmii and a nand backup.</li>
<li>It's probably unnecessary, but you should disconnect all peripherals from the Wii during the modding procedure unless instructed otherwise. This includes gamecube memory cards, gamecube controllers, Wii Speak, etc.</li>
<li>USB hard drives configured to work on a Wii will also work on vWii (virtual Wii on WiiU) and Wii Mini and vice versa.</li>
