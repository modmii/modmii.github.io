<i>The HackMii installer will enable you to install the Homebrew Channel and Bootmii.<br>
The Homebrew Channel allows you to launch homebrew applications off your SD card or Hard Drive.<br>
Bootmii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage and provides brick protection.</i><br>

<br>
<b><u>Some notes about Bootmii as IOS and Bootmii as boot2</u></b><br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>It is recommended to have Bootmii installed as both IOS and as boot2, if possible.
<li>Installing Bootmii as boot2 is only an option available on older Wii's and it provides the greatest level of brick protection.
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>Do not worry if your Wii is not capable of installing Bootmii as boot2, all Wii's can still install Priiloader; and with Priiloader installed you can recover from the majority of bricks. So long as you do not uninstall Priiloader, your System Menu, or System Menu IOS you will be able to recover even without Bootmii installed as boot2.
	<li>If Bootmii is installed to boot2, you can access Bootmii and the Homebrew Channel before the system menu (or Priiloader) is loaded, this will allow you to launch homebrew as needed to fix bricks or restore NAND backups. If Bootmii is installed to boot2, it will load the Bootmii menu each time the Wii starts up <u>only if</u> a Bootmii folder is detected on your SD card. If you move or rename this folder, the Wii will continue to boot the system menu (or Priiloader if installed).
	</ul>
<li>All Wii's are able to install Bootmii as IOS.
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>While Bootmii as IOS does not by itself provide much brick protection, it will allow you to make a NAND backup. When combined with Priiloader, a NAND backup may help you recover from potential semi-bricks in the future.
	</ul>
</ul>
