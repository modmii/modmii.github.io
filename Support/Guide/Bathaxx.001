Requirements: A copy of "LEGO Batman", a standard SD card (will not work with an SDHC or SDXC card), and a nunchuck. Does not work on Korean System Menus. Can launch elfs but not dols. Works on Wii and vWii.<br>
<br>
<ol type="A"><li>Load the LEGO Batman game at least once (otherwise you won't be able to copy over the hack).</li>
<li>Delete or move\backup your personal "LEGO Batman" save file.</li>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you want to move\copy your save data to the same SD card with your ModMii files, first rename the SD:\private folder containing the exploit to something else. Then copy your save from the console to your SD Card and backup the new private folder with your save. Finally rename the original exploit folder back to SD:\private and reinsert the SD Card into your console before continuing to the next step. At the end of this guide you can restore the backup you made.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Go into Wii Options - Data Management - Save Data - Wii - SD Card then copy over the "LEGO Batman" save that corresponds to your region.</li>
<li>Start the LEGO Batman game. Load the new save file.</li>
<li>You are now in the batcave, walk towards the camera and to the right (Batman's left) and take the elevator.</li>
<li>Then in the trophy room, go to the upper corner and go through the door to the "Wayne Manor". Now you can select a character.</li>
<li>Choose the last enabled character in the bottom right to launch the exploit and load your homebrew application.</li></ol>
