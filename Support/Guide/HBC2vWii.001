<!-----------------------Dump Mii NAND steps below----------------------------------->
<b>Use Dump Mii NAND to Make a NAND backup</b><br>
<i>Creating a NAND backup is similar to creating a system restore point in Windows. Should you ever brick your console, restoring a NAND backup is like taking it back in time to before the problem occurred. NAND backups are console specific, so you cannot restore a backup from a different console.</i><br>
<br>

<ol type="A">
<li><b>Launch "Dump Mii NAND"</b> from the Homebrew Channel; the backup process will start automatically.
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>Do not power off your console or remove your SD card when making your NAND backup.
	<li>This process takes 10-30 minutes to complete; your mileage may vary.
	</ul>
<li>At this point, or immediately following the completion of this guide, you should remove the SD card from the console (it is safe to do so while inside the HBC), backup the nand.bin and keys.bin files from your SD to a hard drive, the cloud, or anywhere safe. You might need these in case of emergencies, so don't lose them. Optionally erase them from the SD card after backing them up to free up space. When done, safely remove your SD Card from your computer and reinsert it into your console and proceed to the next step.
</ol>

<br>
<i>Fun Fact! You can extract the contents of your nand.bin by opening it with ModMii, then save it to a hard drive or SD Card to act as a vWii Emulated NAND (or virtual NAND), allowing you switch between the vWii's real NAND and one or more Emulated NANDs. Emulated NANDs can provide much more storage space than the vWii's internal memory.</i><br>
