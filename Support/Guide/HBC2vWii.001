<!--vWiiNAND--<font size=5><li>Make a vWii NAND backup</li></font><br>--vWiiNAND-->
<b>Use nanddumper@IOS to Make a NAND backup</b><br>
<i>Creating a NAND backup is similar to creating a system restore point in Windows. Should you ever brick your console, restoring a NAND backup is like taking it back in time to before the problem occurred. NAND backups are console specific, so you cannot restore a backup from a different console.</i><br>
<br>

<ol type="A">
<li><b>Launch "nanddumper@IOS"</b> from the Homebrew Channel.
<li>If both an SD Card and a USB Hard Drive are connected to the console you will be prompted to choose which device to save your NAND dump to.
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>Use the D-Pad to navigate and <kbd>A</kbd> to make your selection.
	</ul>
<li>Press <kbd>A</kbd> to start the NAND backup (or any button that is <u>not</u> HOME/START/EJECT).
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>Do not power off your console or remove your device.
	<li>This process takes 4-5 minutes to complete.
	</ul>
<li>At this point, or immediately following the completion of this guide, you should remove the device from the console (it is safe to do so while inside the HBC), backup the nand.bin and keys.bin files from /wii/backups/ on your device to your PC, the cloud, or anywhere safe. You might need these in case of emergencies, so don't lose them. Optionally erase them from the device after backing them up to free up space. When done, safely remove your device from your computer and reinsert it into your console and proceed to the next step.
</ol>

<br>
<i>Fun Fact! You can extract the contents of your nand.bin by opening it with ModMii, then save it to a hard drive or SD Card to act as a vWii Emulated NAND (or virtual NAND), allowing you switch between the vWii's real NAND and one or more Emulated NANDs. Emulated NANDs can provide much more storage space than the vWii's internal memory.</i><br>
