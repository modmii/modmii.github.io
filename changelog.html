<h2 id="8.0.1"><a href="#8.0.1">8.0.1 Changelog - 2025:04-10:</a></h2>

<a href="https://github.com/modmii/modmii.github.io/releases/tag/8.0.1" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/modmii/modmii.github.io/8.0.1/total?label=downloads&logo=github" border="0"></a><br>

<h3>Main Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added option to skip files from ModMii's File Cleanup function, so you can pick and choose exactly what gets cleaned\removed. Some additional files were also added to ModMii's File Cleanup list.
<li>ModMii Classic's Advanced Downloads page has been drastically changed\improved. Users can now construct multiple different versions of d2x cIOSs in the same download queue. Adding advanced cIOS downloads to a queue is much faster with less prompts than before. Added option to Remove Last Advanced Download from queue in case you make a mistake. Advanced cIOS download slots are now limited to a range of 200-253; this means that there is zero risk of bricking from any of ModMii's Advanced Downloads (EXCEPT User-Defined Custom Downloads, which can still be dangerous if you do not know what you are doing).
<ul>
<li>Download queues are loaded differently for queues built using modmii 8.0.0 or lower vs 8.0.1+. 8.0.1+ queues will works as you would expect and support multiple versions of d2x in the same queue. Old queues 8.0.0 or lower (built for a single version of d2x) will continue to be adjusted to sync with the version of d2x selected in ModMii's options.
<li>All IOSs have been removed from the Advanced Downloads page; these can still be retrieved using ModMii's User-Defined Custom Download option.
</ul>
<li>When completing a wizard that includes d2x cIOSs ModMii will now prompt users if they want to switch to the latest "recommended" d2x cIOS instead of the "bundled" cIOS. The Recommended version of d2x can now be toggled by entering "R" in the d2x options page. Restoring default settings will also enable the recommended d2x version if it differs from the bundled version and notify the user accordingly.
<ul>
<li>ModMii will only check for other d2x versions available online once per session. This makes changing d2x versions multiple times in a single session much faster.
<li>At startup, but no more than once per day, ModMii will silently check\confirm the latest "recommended" d2x cIOS version.
</ul>
<li>ModMii's Advanced Downloads Forwarder Builder can now also create hidden channel forwarder WADs (not applicable for for Channel ID Forwarder types as this would be redundant). Particularly useful for WiiU users booting Wii homebrew or games directly from WUHB forwarders but don't want channels to be visible or take up space in the Wii menu.
<li>Enhanced ModMii's App Launcher with support for wuhb, rpx and wps files to be able to wiiload these file types from your PC to your WiiU via the internet (requires Wiiload Plugin).
<li>Added Wiiload & FTPiiU plugins for WiiU\Aroma to Download Page 5 and to App Updater checks.
<li>Updated bundled version of d2x cIOS to <a href="https://github.com/wiidev/d2x-cios/releases/tag/d2x-v11-beta3" target="_blank">v11 beta3</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
<li>All options are now saved automatically when changed and the dedicated save settings option has been removed.
<li>When setting SD or USB HDD drive letter (or Path) via the options menu ModMii will now ask if you would like to scan it for apps to update or clean (only after a quick cursory check for apps or wiiu folder). The same is done in ModMii Skin but it will notify the user even if nothing is found since this serves as the only File Cleanup & App Updater option in ModMii Skin.
<li>File Cleanup & App Updater operations will no longer change the saved SD Card Drive\Path setting.
<li>Added Context Menu & Launchpad Toolbar info and Installer\Uninstaller to ModMii Classic's Options (in addition to the "F = open a File or Folder" menu). See <a href="https://modmii.github.io/changelog.html#7.0.0">7.0.0 changelog</a> for more info.
</ul>

<h3>Guide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added steps to applicable guides to check\change MBR partition style of SD cards (in addition to USB HDDs) since these days they are not always necessarily sold as MBR by default.
<li>Enhanced Priiloader steps in guides noting how to handle potential "cIOSPAGHETTI" errors.
<li>When downloading yawmME ONLY as part of a SysCheck Updater Wizard\guide, ModMii ensures \WAD\wm_config.txt is disabled to make sure no custom config settings cause issues like <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/yawm-modmii-edition-v1-0-released.628012/post-10610452" target="_blank">this one</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Minor Bugfixes and Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>ModMii now adds a / (forward slash) at the start of v14 forwarder dol paths. Most homebrew does not care about this so it went unnoticed for so long. ModMii's v14 USBLoader(s) forwarder has been similarly updated but there should be no need to update from the older version.
<li>Fixed bug in vWii SysCheck Updater Wizard where vIOS80 and Priiloader were always thought to need updates.
<li>Fixed minor bug where ModMii Skin vWii wizard functions allowed users to proceed with custom d2x versions enabled that do not support vWii base IOS38 so long as the other 3 vWii base IOSs were supported. In those cases a vWii cIOS with base 38 would just have been excluded from downloads\guides.
<li>Fixed bug where loading one download queue then going back and loading a second queue caused the items from the first queue to still be toggled.
<li>Fixed bug where ModMii would sometimes crash when downloading apps from oscwii.org if either the site was down or the PC was offline. Now if there's no access to oscwii.org ModMii will consider the cached version in its temp folder as the latest available (if applicable), otherwise the download will be reported as Missing.
<li>Fixed ModMii's App Launcher feature from being unable to correctly retrieve arguments from meta.xml's that improperly included null byte(s), or that included single line comments before any arguments (block comments were fine). Also adjusted meta.xml argument parsing to exclude any args contained within disabled_arguments tags (which was recently introduced by USB Loader GX in r1282).
<li>Fixed bug when listing options for d2x or skin themes where extra invalid options were displayed; this was harmless because they could not be toggled.
<li>Fixed harmless "Could Not Find C:\ModMii\temp\DLgotos.txt" error that was sometimes displayed when building emunands. Even if this error was encountered the results would have been correct.
<li>Fixed minor bug that occurred if ModMii Classic was run as an Administrator and one of the Download Pages was launched, resulting in the ModMii console window staying open instead of getting hidden.
<li>If ModMii Classic is run as an administrator, the onscreen directions informing users they can drag and drop files onto the console window to avoid typing the path is no longer displayed (as this capability is disabled when run as Administrator). Note there has never been a requirement to run ModMii as an administrator unless you choose to have it install or write to a protected folder.
<li>Updated shortcut-er launchers (ModMii.exe, ModMiiSkin.exe and ModMii_32bit.exe) to also detect instances of ModMii if run as an Administrator (e.g. "Administrator:  ModMii") in order to better warn users against running multiple instances of ModMii.
<li>ModMii Skin and ModMii.bat will switch to the 32bit version of ModMii.exe on older unsupported versions of Windows, even if it is a 64bit OS. The 32bit version of ModMii.exe will not magically make ModMii fully work with older versions of Windows, but it will make things a bit better.
<li>Updated optional "Spin" channel effect when applying themes. The change was just to resize the channel outline as described <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-themer-org.628144/post-10614298" target="_blank">here</a>.
<li>Updated the version of wiiload used by ModMii to v0.5.3-1 and removed App Launcher filesize check (validated on receiver)
<li>For your protection, ModMii's IOS WAD Modifier now restricts users from changing a stub IOS's slot to one used used by system menus.
<li>Other minor changes.
</ul>

<a href="https://github.com/modmii/modmii.github.io/releases/tag/8.0.0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/modmii/modmii.github.io/8.0.0/total?label=downloads&logo=github" border="0"></a><br>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support to softmod the WiiU (with Aroma), vWii, or both. All ModMii features now also support WiiU/vWii except HackMii Solutions Wizard (inapplicable), Region Change Wizard and SNEEK Installation. Notably ModMii can now build vWii d2x cIOS WADs, vWii EmuNANDs, analyze vWii SysChecks, construct vWii themes and support vWii nand dumps.
<li>ModMii still does not fully support the Wii Mini however it can now build Wii Mini themes by opening mym or csm files with ModMii.
<li>ModMii v8.0.0+ requires 64-bit Windows 8.1 or higher and Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 for all features to work properly.
<li>All .NET Framework 3.5 system requirements have been removed.
<li>A lot of supporting apps and processes have been improved, removed or replaced by WiiPy.
<li>ModMii’s File Cleanup & App Updater feature drastically improved. It will now check if updates are available for every single Wii/vWii/WiiU app available on Open Shop Channel and Homebrew App Store libraries (over 400 apps!), plus Aroma, Environment Loader & Nand Dumper.
<li>New recommended NandLoader for Forwarder Channel WADs (OpenDolBoot’s nboot)! ModMii can now modify the NandLoader of a Channel WAD (or folder of WADs) to work simultaneously for Wii and vWii! Wii Game Shortcut Creator (WiiGSC) has been similarly updated to <a href="https://github.com/modmii/WiiGSC/releases" target="_blank">v1.1 ModMii Edition</a>.
<li>New option when modifying applicable Channel WADs (or folder of WADs) to be able to detect, disable, and re-enable Deflicker video filters. Can also apply/remove N64 Expansion Pak and N64 Dark Filter patches for applicable N64 WADs.
<li>New “Game Image tools” menu/feature supporting wbfs, iso, ciso filetypes (or folders containing these file types). Options include the ability to Disable Deflicker, Re-enable Deflicker, or Extract game contents of Wii and Gamecube games.
<li>WAD Modifier: Added ability to detect and modify the following additional Channel WAD Attributes: AHB Access, DVD Video Access, NandLoader, Deflicker, Visibility (with optional minimalist banner to reduce filesize).
<li>New “Inspector Wadget” feature (get it?); inspect and display WAD Information on any WAD or folder of WADs. Displays WAD Info like cIOS tags, AHB or DVD Video Access, NandLoader, Deflicker, etc.
<li>When building/modifying an EmuNAND using ModMii Classic, users can now also input ANY mym or csm to customize the theme.
<li>Updated bundled d2x version to <a href="https://github.com/wiidev/d2x-cios/releases" target="_blank">v11-beta2</a>.
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyorot/debug-cmios/releases/tag/swiss-cmios-r1788">Swiss cMIOS r1788</a> has replaced WiiGator/WiiPower’s cMIOS as ModMii’s recommended cMIOS; however a cMIOS is still excluded from ModMii’s recommended setup by default (adjustable in ModMii’s options). Swiss cMIOS r1788 should behave identically to WiiGator/WiiPower’s cMIOS and official MIOS except if Y is held during any GameCube mode load it will start the built-in Swiss.
<li>Reorganized Download Pages. Added a number of WiiU Homebrew downloads to a Download Page 5 (new). Moved PC Program downloads from page 2 to 5.

</ul>

<h3>WiiU & vWii</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support to softmod the WiiU (with Aroma), vWii, or both. All ModMii features now also support WiiU/vWii except HackMii Solutions Wizard (inapplicable), Region Change Wizard and SNEEK Installation. Thanks goes out to all the WiiU/vWii devs that made this possible but especially <a href="https://github.com/Maschell" target="_blank">@Maschell</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GaryOderNichts" target="_blank">@GaryOderNichts</a> who are absolute legends!
<ul>
<li>Technical details: ModMii’s WiiU softmod process is generally aligned with wiiu.hacks.guide. Notably ModMii includes some additional Aroma plugins/apps by default, such as Bloopair, evWii, GiveMiiYouTube, Inkay for Pretendo, Screenshot Plugin, WiiU Disc Dumper, WiiVCLaunch, etc.
<li>Technical details: ModMii’s vWii softmod process includes EULA WAD installation to prevent update loops when enabling Priiloader’s Permanent vWii System Settings (vWii) system menu hack. It also includes an upgraded Photo Channel v1.1 (including HAZA and a custom vWii IOS61; which is a copy of vIOS56), Mii Channel (to enable some features which are missing on vWii, such as connecting a DS or moving Mii’s to Wii remotes), and 43DB patches (to fix the aspect ratio for the Everybody Votes and Check Mii Out channels). Essentially ModMii does much of what System Channel Restorer & ww-43db-patcher can do but in different ways.
</ul>
<li>Custom <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modmii/modmii.github.io/refs/heads/master/Support/Skins/Default/splash.png" target="_blank">splash screen</a> added to WiiU/Aroma boot (thanks <a href="https://github.com/emilydaemon" target="_blank">@emilydaemon</a>!) and can be customized by including splash.png in ModMii Skin themes. Note that ModMii will not overwrite existing splash screens if detected on SD.
</ul>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated bundled d2x version to <a href="https://github.com/wiidev/d2x-cios/releases" target="_blank">v11-beta2</a>, thanks <a href="https://github.com/wiidev" target="_blank">@wiidev</a> aka blackb0x!
<li>Building vWii d2x cIOS WADs are supported for all d2x versions newer than v9 (except base 38 which requires v11-beta2 or newer). If an unsupported d2x version is selected in ModMii’s Options, vWii cIOSs are disabled on download pages. If the selected d2x version does not support vWii, it will be restored to default before downloading files for a vWii wizard/guide. If the selected d2x version is not ModMii’s default/bundled version, users will be prompted if they would like to revert to default before Wii or vWii wizard/guide operations.
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyorot/debug-cmios/releases/tag/swiss-cmios-r1788" target="_blank">Swiss cMIOS r1788</a> has replaced WiiGator/WiiPower’s cMIOS as ModMii’s recommended cMIOS (thanks <a href="https://github.com/pyorot" target="_blank">@pyorot</a> aka shoutplenty); however a cMIOS is still excluded from ModMii’s recommended setup by default (adjustable in ModMii’s options). Swiss cMIOS r1788 is a cMIOS with Swiss r1788 built-in. Hold Y during any GameCube mode load to start the built-in Swiss. If Y is not held then it should behave identically to WiiGator/WiiPower’s cMIOS and official MIOS.
<li>Added 2 downloads to grab the complete Open Shop Channel (OSC) Wii App Library and the complete Homebrew App Store (HBAS) WiiU Library. Users can configure the Skipped Apps option if they want ModMii to exclude certain apps from the OSC or HBAS complete app library downloads. By default Legacy HBAS apps are skipped as well as extra/large RetroArch cores.
<ul>
<li>All OSC and HBAS downloads (both bulk and individual) are auto-updating and able to check if the currently downloaded version is already up-to-date.
<li>ModMii’s HBAS downloads save download info to SD:/wiiu/apps/appstore/.get/packages/ in a format compatible with the appstore. Big thanks goes out to the HBAS team but especially <a href="https://github.com/vgmoose" target="_blank">@vgmoose</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pwsincd" target="_blank">@pwsincd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nightkingale" target="_blank">@Nightkingale</a>.
</ul>
<li>ModMii’s File Cleanup & App Updater feature drastically improved. It will now check if updates are available for every single Wii/vWii/WiiU app available on OSC and HBAS libraries (over 400 apps!), plus Aroma, Environment Loader & Nand Dumper. Users can add apps to a Skipped Apps list if they do not want ModMii to update it for some reason. The Skipped Apps list is accessible via ModMii’s Options menu as well as the File Cleanup & App Updater menu.
<ul>
<li>Added more apps to ModMii’s File Cleanup list: PriiloaderWiiUForwarder, UFDiine, MyMenuifyMod, CSM Installer, wup_installer, vWii Compat Installer, Payload-Loader Installer, Wii U Account Swap, etc.
</ul>
<li>Reorganized Download Pages. Added a number of WiiU Homebrew downloads to a Download Page 5 (new). Moved PC Program downloads from page 2 to 5. Download Page 2 has been reorganized into “Exploits”, “Wii-Only Homebrew”, “vWii-Only Homebrew” and “Wii & vWii Homebrew” categories.
<li>New Downloads:
<ul>
<li>Page 1: 3x vWii System Menus, 29x vWii IOSs, Wii Speak [K], Photo Channel 1.1 [K] (including HAZA; referenced below), vWii IOS61 (for Photo Channel v1.1 support; basically a copy of vWii IOS56), vWii IOS80 (patched), 3x vWii Region Select, 2x vWii BC (BC-NAND & BC-WFS), 0d.app from vIOS80 v7200 to support (manually) building neek for vWii
<li>Page 2: OSC Wii App Library, HackMii Installer v1.0, System Channel Restorer, Dump Mii NAND, csm-installer, Patched IOS80 Installer for vWii, HBC v1.1.3 WAD [OHBC], HBC v1.1.4-1 WAD [OHBC], ww-43db-patcher
<li>Page 3: 4x themes for vWiiU vWiiE and vWiiJ (plus base app/theme files)
<li>Page 4: vWii d2x cIOS248[38], vWii d2x cIOS249[56], vWii d2x cIOS250[57], vWii d2x cIOS251[58], <a href="https://github.com/pyorot/debug-cmios/releases/tag/swiss-cmios-r1788" target="_blank">Swiss cMIOS r1788</a>, DIOS MIOS v2.11
<li>Page 5: HB App Store WiiU Library, Homebrew App Store, Aroma, Nand Dumper, Environment Loader, vWii Compat Installer, Wii U Disc Dumper (WUDD), WUP Installer GX2 (WUHB), Bloopair, Inkay for Pretendo, GiveMiiYouTube, Screenshot (WUPS), Enhanced vWii (evWii), SaveMii Mod (WUT Port), WiiVCLaunch, WiiUIdent, Tiramisu, Wii U Account Swap, 5x PC Programs which were also added to the Uninstaller [UStealth, WiiLink Patcher, NUSGet, Cemu, UWUVCI (Ultimate Wii U Virtual Console Injectors)].
<li>Advanced Downloads Page: vWii d2x cIOS248[38], vWii d2x cIOS249[56], vWii d2x cIOS250[57], vWii d2x cIOS251[58]
</ul>
<li>Updated Downloads:
<ul>
<li>WiiGSC updated to v1.1 ModMii Edition; which notably supports building Wii game shortcut channels that work on both Wii and vWii using DacoTaco’s OpenDolBoot nboot NandLoader. More information on WiiGSC’s other changes can be found under its own <a href="https://github.com/modmii/WiiGSC/releases" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.
<li>Photo-Channel-1.1-dummy-HAZA.wad is now created/downloaded along with Photo Channel 1.1 in order for v1.1 to work properly
<li>3x Channels updated to work on vWii in addition to Wii (USB-Loader, postLoader and WiiFlow)
<li>nSwitch channel updated to embed v4.2 and was also modified to have AHB and DVD Video access enabled as well as changing its NandLoader to ODB’s nboot to support installations on both Wii and vWii.
<li>Bootmii SD files updated to v1.5
<li>Converted the following existing downloads to be autoupdating from OSC: MyMenuifyMod, YAWM ModMii Edition, SysCheck ModMii Edition, Priiloader, Load Priiloader, ARC ModMii Edition, fptii, CleanRip, CFG USB Loader and USB Loader GX (GX will actually switch to OSC later on after its bundled meta.xml has been fixed)
<li>Updated NTSC/KOR/JAP themes by <a href="https://github.com/diddy81" target="_blank">@diddy81</a> from the Wii Theme Team. KOR/JPN themes had language and country buttons removed to align with their system menus. NTSC themes fixed a non-critical bug where a typo was pointing to an EU function instead of a US function preventing access to Wii Settings’ Country setting. All themes on Download Page 3 were also updated to no longer be signed by ModMii as it complicates things for very little benefit.
<li>Updated DIOS MIOS Lite (DML) from v1.3 to v2.11
<li>Some WADs previously thought to be fakesigned were updated to truly be fakesigned. ModMii will still consider any Legacy non-fakesigned cIOSs it encounters as valid. Fakesigning is not really necessary anyway unless a vanilla IOS with the original trucha bug is being used/loaded to attempt to install non-fakesigned content.
<li>Removed the RC24 patch from ModMii’s extra brick protection system menu IOSs since it is no longer required for WiiLink. Also the filename format was changed to IOS##v65535(ModMii-IOS60-v6174).wad.
<li>When downloading Dolphin a portable.txt file is now also created as having portable.txt where Dolphin.exe is saved changes its app data location from the User Documents folder to where Dolphin is saved.
<li>EmuPriiloader (the version of Priiloader that ModMii installs to EmuNANDs) updated to 0.10.0 (actually done mid-Dec 2024 even for older versions of ModMii).
<li>Updated Cheat Codes zip download to be static for now instead of autoupdating from https://codes.rc24.xyz/txt.zip. The RC24 download has broken a few times and is no longer being updated.
<li>Updated AccioHacks Cheat Codes “download” and bundled download queue. The “Copy of Cheat Codes for AccioHacks” download does not actually download anything but will save copies of cheats found in txtcodes/ to codes/ in AccioHacks’ expected format. It is automatically queued if both Cheat Codes (txtcodes) and AccioHacks are being downloaded together. To have ModMii only copy existing codes without downloading txtcodes just use the bundled download queue instead.
</ul>
<li>Removed Downloads:
<ul>
<li>Page 1: 3.2 System Menus, deprecated sneek files, some fakesigned IOSs that were not being used (IOS30[30], IOS70[70], IOS80[80]; these can still be retrieved using the advanced downloads menu if a user needs to).
<li>RiiConnect24 Patcher (replaced by WiiLink Patcher on Page 5); RiiConnect24 Patcher retained in the ModMii Uninstaller only.
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Supporting Apps & System Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>A lot of supporting apps and processes have been improved, removed or replaced by WiiPy; thanks <a href="https://github.com/NinjaCheetah" target="_blank">@NinjaCheetah</a> for his work on libWiiPy, WiiPy, NUSGet and more!
<li>Mostly due to using WiiPy, ModMii v8.0.0+ requires 64-bit Windows 8.1 or higher and Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022. ModMii will warn you that some features will not work properly if system requirements are not met.
<li>All .NET Framework 3.5 system requirements have been removed.
<li>Added option to ModMii Classic to download various dependencies now instead of when needed (i.e. ShowMiiVWiiKeys, nand-tools, nandBinCheck, Punetwiin, wiiload, UnRAR, Sharpii .Net Core, OpenDolBoot, wwcxtool, wit, LZ77Helper).
<li>Updated ModMii.exe (i.e. Launcher/Shortcut-er) to not require .NET Framework, always launch using console host instead of windows terminal, and fix a bug causing it to crash if an argument/filepath contained “&(” or “&&&” separated by nothing or only spaces; e.g. “&(.csv” or “& & &.wad”
<li>NUS Downloader no longer bundled to grab WADs from NUS; instead WiiPy is bundled/used. This should resolve random errors or freezing users sometimes encountered (which were usually resolved when retrying downloads anyway).
<li>WadMii/libwiisharp no longer bundled to (un)pack WADs; instead WiiPy is bundled/used.
<li>SMW-Mod/libwiisharp (ShowMiiWads-Mod) no longer bundled to install content to EmuNANDs; instead WiiPy is bundled/used.
<li>ThemeMii Cmd Line (TMCL.exe) is no longer downloaded to create themes; instead themewii.exe is downloaded/used which requires .Net Framework 4.5 (instead of 3.5); thanks goes out to <a href="https://github.com/scooby7402976" target="_blank">@scooby7402976</a> (aka scooby74029) and <a href="https://github.com/wiidev" target="_blank">@wiidev</a> (aka blackb0x). Themes are also no longer signed by ModMii as it complicates things for very little benefit.
<li>TMDedit is no longer bundled to construct d2x cIOSs newer than v9; instead WiiPy is bundled/used to streamline building all d2x versions. A legacy cIOS build method has been added to ModMii & d2x-beta-md5-updater.bat for backwards compatibility. Users will be prompted to enable the legacy cIOS build method if an outdated d2x-beta version is detected and an update for the same version is not available. Alternate d2x cIOS versions hosted online have been updated accordingly. Legacy cios building mode automatically switches back off when changing d2x versions.
<li>Sharpii/libwiisharp/patchIOS no longer bundled for WAD editing and info gathering; instead other tools are used (mostly WiiPy).
<li>Sharpii no longer bundled to send WADs to the HBC via LAN; instead Sharpii .Net Core is downloaded/used only when needed for this function.
<li>settings.exe no longer bundled to build settings.txt; instead WiiPy is bundled/used.
<li>Removed bundled 00000000-template.app; instead created on-the-fly by sfk when needed.
<li>writecbd.exe no longer bundled to build cdb.vff when constructing EmuNANDs; instead fsutil and sfk are used to create it. cdb.vff reduces the amount of time it takes to boot an EmuNAND for the first time.
<li>An older version of wit.exe (& cygwin1.dll) is no longer bundled; instead the latest wit is downloaded/used whenever a game image operation is necessary.
<li>Updated the bundled versions of Wizapp.exe and sfk.exe.
<li>wget no longer opens a separate minimized cmd window when downloading files.
</ul>
<h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
<ul>
<li>WAD Modifier: Added ability to detect and modify the following additional Channel WAD Attributes: AHB Access, DVD Video Access, NandLoader, Deflicker, Visibility (with optional minimalist banner to reduce filesize)
<li>New recommended NandLoader for Forwarder Channel WADs! By leveraging DacoTaco’s OpenDolBoot ModMii can now modify the NandLoader of a Channel WAD (or folder of WADs) to work simultaneously for Wii and vWii! Before now forwarders built for the Wii had to be converted to work on vWii using tools like Convert2vWii or WiiForwarder2vWii to change the NandLoader to “tiny vWii”, and after the change they would no longer work on Wii. Now channels can be converted to work on both consoles without needing two copies of every WAD! Warning: any WADs with modified NandLoaders should always be double checked before assuming it works on both console types. Both OpenDolBoot & OpenHBC NandLoader’s should work on Wii and vWii, but in some tests only one or the other worked. Ultimately the results depend on what app/DOL is being integrated with the NandLoader (and its entrypoint address) or if in the case of forwarders also the app that is being forwarded to.
<li>New NandLoader option when Modifying a Channel WAD (or folder of WADs) to detect and change NandLoader. This essentially makes the Convert2vWii & WiiForwarder2vWii tools obsolete as ModMii can do all they can do and more. Supported NandLoaders include OpenDolBoot (nboot), comex, marcan, OpenHBC, taiko, tiny vWii and waninkoko. OpenDolBoot’s NandLoader (aka nboot) is recommended and generally supports channel loading on both Wii and vWii (thanks <a href="https://github.com/DacoTaco" target="_blank">@DacoTaco</a>!). NandLoaders can either be integrated/merged with a channel’s main dol/app using OpenDolBoot, or sometimes kept separate/external if the WAD is structured that way to begin with. Additional NandLoaders can be saved to ModMii’s Support/NandLoaders folder and they will automatically be supported; details <a href="https://github.com/modmii/modmii.github.io/blob/master/Support/NandLoaders/ReadMe.txt" target="_blank">here</a>. Wii Game Shortcut Creator (WiiGSC) has been similarly updated to v1.1 ModMii Edition; more information on WiiGSC’s other changes can be found under its own <a href="https://github.com/modmii/WiiGSC/releases" target="_blank">release announcement</a>. Note that ModMii will only update DOLs and NandLoaders in Channel WADs with 2 or 3 content files (including banner). These are the types of channels users generally modify; and anything more complicated can/should be done manually by unpacking, modifying, and repacking the WAD.
<li>If a channel WAD is missing a NandLoader, ModMii can repair it when updating its NandLoader or the DOL used by the channel.
<li>New option when modifying applicable Channel WADs (or folder of WADs) to be able to detect, disable, and re-enable Deflicker video filters. Can also disable/re-enable the dark filter on 10 N64 VC Channels. Disabling the Deflicker video filter is recommended when using 480p display mode to improve video quality. Enabling the Deflicker video filter is recommended when using 480i display mode on a CRT TV. Deflicker patching can be done on-the-fly by USB Loaders so editing WADs for Deflicker will often be unnecessary. Thanks Maeson and NoobletCheese for researching video filters in such detail!
<li>New “Game Image tools” menu/feature supporting wbfs, iso, ciso filetypes (or folders containing these file types). Options include the ability to Disable Deflicker, Re-enable Deflicker, or Extract game contents of Wii and Gamecube games. Deflicker patching can be done on-the-fly by USB Loaders for most but not all game images; e.g. any games with multiple dols like Metroid Prime Trilogy or The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return cannot be patched by USB Loaders unless using the alt-dol method to load/patch a specific sub-game/dol at launch. The only known deflicker patch not supported by ModMii is for Gamecube games compiled with gxD.a which is (only?) used in “Sega Soccer Slam”.
<li>Better detection and support of hidden channels when modifying a Channel WAD.
<li>New Visibility option when Modifying a Channel WAD to make a channel visible or invisible/hidden. When making a channel hidden you can also choose to inject a minimalist banner to reduce filesize. Channels with minimalist banners are restricted from being made visible to avoid banner bricks; users will be directed to add a banner first.
<li>Bulk processing of a folder of WADs to be invisible/hidden or have their NandLoaders updated is also supported, however only supported Channel WAD types will be processed (other types will be skipped). All changes are applied to copies of the original WADs.
<li>When modifying a Channel WAD warnings given when selecting IOS61 or a specific Title ID that may cause pillarboxing issues on vWii.
<li>Enhanced information reported on user provided WADs; e.g. if an IOS is for Wii or vWii, installed size in blocks and MBs, Signing Status, cIOS tags and base IOS, cMIOS detection for common cMIOSs, NandLoader (where applicable), Deflicker (where applicable), Content Files, Korean Key, 4x ES module patches (FS:Fakesigning, ES:ES-Identify, NP:Nand-Permission, VP:Version-Patch), etc.
<li>New “Inspector Wadget” feature (get it?); inspect and display WAD Information on any WAD or folder of WADs. Displays WAD Info like cIOS tags, AHB or DVD Video Access, NandLoader, Deflicker, etc. Additional TMD & TIK info can be displayed by following the onscreen directions. Additional OpenDolBoot info on NandLoader & Main DOL (where supported) can be displayed by following the onscreen directions (i.e. adding “Set ODBInfo=Y” to settings.bat).
<li>Warnings displayed if stubbed IOS or unhidden bannerless channel WADs are inspected.
<li>IOS WAD Modifier patches are not always successful depending on the IOS. ModMii will now check which patches were successfully applied and rename the file, if applicable, to align with just the successfully enabled patches.
<li>nand tools: Enhanced to support vWii nand dumps (i.e. slccmpt.bin) in addition to Wii nand.bin’s. Added nand.bin expected size checks. Also added checks for nand.bin’s that are missing appended keys and users are prompted to provide the keys to fix it. Also added ability to detect and repair vWii nand dumps by converting opt.bin to keys.bin using ShowMiiVWiiKeys and appending it to a repaired copy of slccmpt.bin.
<li>A number of enhancements were made to ModMii’s Bootmii.ini creator, including adding an option to autoboot a specific channel’s title ID and load/edit existing settings. If a bootmii.ini file is dragged/opened with ModMii it will automatically load the Bootmii settings editor function.
<li>ModMii’s App Launcher is now also accessible when opening an app folder containing a boot.dol/elf (in addition to any dol/elf file).
<li>HBC File Transfer Tool is now also accessible via ModMii’s App Launcher when loading a boot.dol/elf or an app folder containing a boot.dol/elf (in addition to zip/7z/rar files). The tool now also displays the contents of archives and prompts for confirmation just before initiating a transfer. Any archives including both a boot.dol and boot.elf are now automatically corrected by renaming boot.dol to bootAlt.dol in a temporary copy of the archive to enable transmission.
<li>ModMii can now construct themes, not only just for Wii, but also for vWii and Wii Mini system menu versions by opening mym or csm files with ModMii.
<li>All vWii themes built by ModMii, including the boring Default, have 43DB patches to fix the aspect ratio for the Everybody Votes and Check Mii Out channels.
<li>Wii Mini theme building requires users provide ModMii with the original theme app file (or the complete Mini System Menu WAD) as these files are not available to download from NUS. ModMii does not support Wii Mini consoles in any other way (unless you count the USB-Loader Setup Wizard).
<li>For any file or folder without a dedicated function, ModMii will now offer to (de)compress files/folders using LZ77Helper instead of only offering to calculate file hashes using HashMyFiles.
<li>Any file or folder can now also be opened directly from ModMii Classic’s main menu.
</ul>
<h3>SysCheck Updater</h3>
<ul>
<li>SysCheck Updater Wizard now also supports vWii SysChecks.
<li>If Priiloader is detected when analyzing Wii SysChecks logs, users are asked if they want to update it since SysCheck cannot detect Priiloader’s installed version. No prompts are made for vWii since Priiloader on vWii is relatively new making it impossible for a very outdated version to be installed.
<li>When analyzing SysCheck logs, if a non-critical IOS was skipped by SysCheck, ModMii will now assume it is problematic and suggest it be cleaned/stubbed. If a critical IOS is skipped then ModMii will continue to suggest it be updated appropriately.
<li>SysCheck Updater now gives the option to analyze sysCheck v2.1.0b logs but with a warning. ModMii also now accepts System Menu IOSs as valid if they are v65535 and have Trucha Bug and NAND Access (in addition to v16174 or a ModMii tagged System Menu IOS) to better support analysis of older SysChecks. Users also linked to SysCheck v2.1.0.b19 in case SysCheck ModMii Edition or HDE do not work in rare cases.
<li>When analyzing a SysCheck, ModMii will now display settings that impact how it is being analyzed; i.e. Update Active IOSs (for Wii & vWii SysChecks), Extra Brick Protection (Wii only), Hermes cIOS (Wii Only) and cMIOS (Wii Only). These settings will also continue to be summarized in generated guides.
<li>When generating SysCheck wizard guides, the HBC will now be updated using the hackmii installer instead of yawmME/WAD if the current HBC is older than v1.1.0 (previously v1.0.7). While yawmME’s meta.xml could be modified to use the “no_ios_reload” argument instead of “ahb_access” allowing it to work without cIOS on HBC v1.0.7 & v1.0.8, v1.0.7 is susceptible to network initialization IOS reload bug so the “ahb_access” argument was intentionally retained.
<li>Added support to ModMii’s SysCheck Updater to download and analyze SysChecks that were uploaded to https://syscheck.crafterpika.cc; thanks <a href="https://github.com/CrafterPika" target="_blank">@CrafterPika</a>!
</ul>
<h3>Guide</h3>
<ul>
<li>New guides for installing recommended WiiU softmods, vWii softmods, or both. Outcomes are generally aligned with wii.hacks.guide (procedure may differ; e.g. using WADs to install cIOS instead of the d2x installer). Sample guides can be found <a href="https://modmii.github.io/sampleguides/8.0.0/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks wii.hacks.guide team and <a href="https://github.com/Ingunar" target="_blank">@Ingunar</a> in particular!
<li>Added a ModMii Wizard option to restore the default theme; which includes 43DB patches for vWii to fix the aspect ratio for the Everybody Votes and Check Mii Out channels. csm-installer is used in both vWii and Wii guides to install themes; previously Wii guides used MyMenuifyMod.
<li>Added an extra <a href="https://wilbrand.donut.eu.org" target="_blank">Wilbrand Web</a> exploit option for 3.x-4.2 guides; thanks <a href="https://github.com/emilydaemon" target="_blank">@emilydaemon</a>!
<li>HackMii Solutions Wizard now downloads v1.0 of the HackMii Installer in addition to v1.2. HackMii Solutions guides direct users to try v1.0 if v1.2 does not work.
<li>Added IOS56 to Region Change Wizard in case users do not have it installed and thus prevents installing EULA v3. The EULA WAD is now named differently only when downloaded as part of a Region Change Wizard to come after the IOS56 prerequisite; i.e. changed from EULA-NUS-v3 to NUS-EULA-v3.
<li>HTML guides will now open with whatever browser Windows is configured to use for http. Users without HTML file associations will no longer be prompted to choose what app to open guides with. This change was inspired after shaking my head at <a href="https://youtu.be/IMAHP-3sm4A?si=S8iQx54pRMAKxxXw&t=442" target="_blank">this youtuber</a> when he closes the prompt to choose what browser to open his guide with and says “all you gotta do is press the escape key on the keyboard”.
<li>Replaced RiiConnect24 with WiiLink throughout all guide references.
<li>Other guide enhancements, including references to RiiTag, UTag, Seagate &gt;2TB HDD tutorial (in addition to WD), diagram of proper SD/USB file structure, fixed broken links, etc.
</ul>
<h3>EmuNAND STUFF</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added an option to build vWii EmuNANDs (but NOT neek for vWii). Both Wii and vWii EmuNANDs should work interchangeably in USB Loader GX so vWii EmuNAND support may not have been necessary.
<li>Installing an nSwitch (neek2o) Channel is now optional when building or modifying EmuNANDs instead of always being installed.
<li>Updated default setting.txt serial number for Korean EmuNANDs to use an “LKM” prefix.
<li>When building/modifying an EmuNAND using ModMii Classic, users can input any mym or csm to customize the theme (only for SMs 4.1 or higher). Previously only the 4 themes offered by ModMii were supported. This makes quickly changing themes to test in Dolphin or neek super fast and easy!
<li>When modifying an EmuNAND some info on the loaded nand is displayed onscreen; e.g. SM Version, Region, Console Type, Installed Titles, Space used, whether HBC or other content is installed, etc. Previously only Priiloader was detected.
<li>All EmuNAND modifier pages can be cycled through by leaving the selection blank and hitting enter, similar to WAD editing.
</ul>
<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed ModMii’s Game Bulk Extractor so that if extracting a GameCube disc image, the real files will be extracted instead of creating a ‘game.iso’ copy.
<li>Sharpii, patchIOS and libwiisharp’s fakesigning does not actually work so ModMii now uses WiiPy for fakesigning. Fakesigning is not really necessary anyway unless a vanilla IOS with the original trucha bug is being used/loaded to attempt to install non-fakesigned content.
<li>Fixed bug that sometimes occurs when modifying a user provided Channel WAD to inject a new DOL using Sharpii. Sharpii always assumes the main DOL is in the same position but some channels have different boot index order and Sharpii can get it wrong (i.e. it may break the channel by replacing the NandLoader instead of the main DOL). Other tools like CustomizeMii and possibly ShowMiiWads have the same issue.
<li>ModMii can properly handle modifying a user provided Channel WAD to inject a new DOL whether the NandLoader is external or integrated with its main DOL. Channels with integrated NandLoaders (other than the HBC) have not become widespread, but with this ModMii update making it easier to do that may change. Other tools like Sharpii, Customize Mii, ShowMiiWads, etc. may need to be updated to handle replacing DOLs in channels that have integrated NandLoaders and/or external NandLoaders in an unconventional position (as detailed above). Note that ModMii will only update DOLs and NandLoaders in Channel WADs with 2 or 3 content files (including banner). These are the types of channels users generally modify; and anything more complicated can/should be done manually by unpacking, modifying, and repacking the WAD.
<ul>
<li>Technical details: When replacing a channel’s main DOL, ModMii will check the position of the main DOL and NandLoader in both source and donor WADs, and it will check if they have integrated or external NandLoaders. If replacing a DOL with an integrated NandLoader ModMii checks to make sure the new DOL also has one integrated, and if it doesn’t ModMii will automagically integrate OpenDolBoot’s nandloader before injecting it. If replacing a DOL without an integrated NandLoader but the new DOL has it integrated, ModMii will replace it and also remove the channel’s external NandLoader and change its boot index to 1.
</ul>
<li>Fixed WAD Modifier bug that occurred when changing the Title ID of a channel where its type would also get set to 00010001 whether it was that way to begin with or not. 00010001 is a common channel type for WADs users typically edit so it was never reported and I just happened to notice. This is actually still a Sharpii bug but now ModMii uses WiiPy for this purpose.
<li>Fixed HTA file association “ERROR: temp/tempcheck.txt not found!” bug experienced by a small number of users when trying to open a download page. ModMii now specifies mshta is to be used to open HTA files in case file associations are not properly set in Windows.
</ul>
<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of user inputs and support for filenames with special characters.
<li>Removed the option to keep NUS and 00000001 folder for IOSs/MIOSs/SMs/etc; previously this was useful for offline usage of some deprecated apps.
<li>Users are now only prompted to input “I Agree” once per ModMii version; i.e. asked once then will not be asked again until the next update.
<li>The ModMii Installer will now add the ModMii installation path as a Microsoft security exception. This is only done if a user has already given required permissions to the installer itself.
<li>Added yet another small Easter Egg to ModMii Classic. Happy hunting!
<li>Other relatively minor changes.
<li>Q: XFlak, how many hours have you spent on ModMii by now? A: IT’S OVER 9000!!!
</ul>

<li>This is likely the last ModMii update that will fully support 32-bit windows or Windows 8 and older. This is a small bug-fix only update so that users unable to use the next BIG update will have something more stable to fall back on.
<li>Reverted the server used by NusFileGrabber back to NUS from RC24's redirect to resolve downloads impacting building themes or sneek.
<li>Updated sourceforge download links to resolve "Some files required for neek installation are missing" issue.
<li>Fixed bug in mym and csm drag and drop theme building operations if the path contained an even number of folders.
<li>Fixed bug where Photo-Channel-1.0-NUS-v2 was not being listed in the Install WADs step of guides for Korean region Wiis.
<li>Fixed harmless "Get-Disk.vbs not found" bug which only impacted ModMii Skin users. This message was safe to ignore as it only indicated that it was unable to detect the format details of connected drives to include in guides saving users the trouble of having to manually check.
<li>Updated broken download links for Bootmii SD files, WiiMC-SS and Customize Mii. Even before this release these issues were being automatically repaired when ModMii checked for updates.
<li>Updated download link for USB Loader GX as the oscwii.org package has problems (for now) with its bundled meta.xml. Even before this release this issue was being automatically repaired when ModMii checked for updates.
<li>Updated Wiimmfi DNS IP. Even before this release this issue was being automatically repaired when ModMii checked for updates.
<li>Stay tuned; I promise the next update will be more exciting!

<li>Removed prompt to retain patched IOS31 if detected in SysChecks as it is no longer required for RiiConnect24.
<li>SysCheck updater now also checks to make sure BC is v6.
<li>Removed the following whitelisted slots from suggesting they optionally be stubbed in the SysCheck updater wizard (236,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247).
<li>Fix for IOSs that were skipped by SysCheck. Previously if "IOS249: Skipped" (for example) was contained in a SysCheck, ModMii suggested installing both the recommended cIOS249 as well as a stub IOS249, but ModMii appropriately never actually constructed a stub IOS249.
<li>Fixed SysCheck updater MIOS issue where a stock MIOS v10 was not installed when "MIOS v10 (DIOS MIOS Lite)" was listed in syschecks (and cMIOS option disabled).
<li>Other minor changes, including references to Fakemote as well as updating wii.guide links to wii.hacks.guide (or archived links where no replacement exists yet).

<li>SysCheck Updater will now also suggest stubbing\removing IOS 252 and higher if detected (except IOS254 Bootmii). This is to ensure the recommended IOS248-251 are selected by USB Loader GX's Auto IOS setting, which prefers higher IOS slots all else being equal. Users wishing to use unique cIOS configurations should install them to slots 240-247 to avoid being nagged, or simply ignore optional recommendations to stub\remove cIOSs that you want to keep.
<li>SysCheck Updater will now suggest removing Hermes cIOSs (when detected) if the Hermes cIOS option is disabled. If enabled, ModMii will continue to direct users to install Hermes cIOSs if missing.
<li>To avoid redundant recommendations, ModMii's SysCheck Updater will not recommend removing\stubbing IOSs if already stubbed by ModMii (e.g. stub IOS is rev 404).
<li>If the only SysCheck Updater recommendation is to stub\remove some IOSs a custom message is displayed indicating this is optional and all other mods are up to date.
<li>Added check to SysCheck Updater to abort if it detects a Wii Mini System Menu version (v4609 or v4610).
<li>Fixed bug causing ModMii to crash if analyzing a SysCheck log that is in French and also references an older version of the HBC (1.1.0 and lower).
<li>Fixed Bug preventing the selection of alternate d2x cIOS versions and ModMii Skin themes that are hosted online.
<li>Fixed bug causing ModMii to crash if running a Spanish version of Windows and missing NET Framework 3.5 or trying to install neek.

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many new Drag and Drop supported file types, features and functions
(e.g. nand.bin check/clone/defragment, WAD modify/unpack/trasmit, mym
&amp; csm theme creation, dol &amp; elf app launcher, zip HBC transfer
tool, etc.).</li>
<li>New default cIOS (d2x-v11-beta1) and recommended cIOS configuration
(248[38], 249[56], 250[57], 251[58]).</li>
<li>YAWM ModMii Edition replaced MMM and Some YAWMM Mod in all
wizards/guides. Now all functions support Wii motion+ remotes and/or do
not require manually changing SD:/boot.elf/dol in between guide
steps.</li>
<li>Guide optimizations, improvements and additions (e.g. GPT to MBR
conversion, added 2 new HDD format options WBFS &amp; FAT32+WBFS,
new/improved Youtube videos, re-ordered/combined/streamlined steps,
etc.).</li>
<li>Added optional step to SysCheck Updater guides to carefully stub or
erase unnecessary IOS slots that should be empty using stub IOS
WADs.</li>
<li>UI changes: changes to icons, new default ModMii Skin theme, new
ModMii Skin theme selector, optional Launchpad Toolbar, optional Context
Menu (right-click) access to ModMii.</li>
<li>Complete GUI redesign of ModMii Classic Download Pages (excluding
Advanced Downloads Page).</li>
<li>(Re)introduced auto-updating and semi-auto-updating downloads.</li>
<li>Many new/updated downloads. Notably a dozen new PC Programs were
added.</li>
<li>A custom uninstaller is now bundled with ModMii allowing you to
uninstall some or all of ModMii’s components.</li>
<li>App Updater: new feature added to File Cleanup function on main
menu. Users now prompted if they want to check for updates to
auto-updating apps detected on the device (excluding Dolphin and OSC),
or to delete unnecessary files, or both.</li>
<li>Updated bundled version of NUS Downloader Command Line from v0.2 to
v0.6. The old NUSD did not perfectly create TMDs. Imperfect TMDs were
not generally problematic and have been used without issues for many
years. However, the new YAWM ModMii Edition will prevent installation of
any WAD that is not perfect for security reasons. As a result, many of
the WADs in ModMii’s temp folder from older versions will be deemed
invalid going forward and will be automatically re-downloaded. To
correct the files in your temp folder all at once, download the items
from the bundled “NUS_2023_Changes” download queue.</li>
<li>Other changes and bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drag and Drop:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you can’t drag and drop it onto ModMii then it probably isn’t Wii
related, because ModMii drops it like it’s hot!</li>
<li>Added support for dragging and dropping multiple items at once.</li>
<li>Added a new option to ModMii Classic’s main menu to open a File or
Folder with ModMii, behaves same as drag and drop except it does not
support opening multiple items at once.
<ul>
<li>Includes ModMii Launchpad Toolbar Installer/Uninstaller to add or
remove a quicklaunch-like toolbar to your taskbar giving you easy access
to drag and drop functions.</li>
<li>Includes Context Menu Installer/Uninstaller to add or remove “Open
with ModMii” to your right-click context menu (or
Shift-right-click).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added Drag and Drop support for many new file types and features,
including:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>nand.bin tools (nand.bin); Extract, Check, Clone or Defragment a Wii
nand.bin file
<ul>
<li>Extract a nand.bin into folder format structure to use as an
emulated nand</li>
<li>Check a nand.bin using nandBinCheck to confirm it is safe to install
on a Wii</li>
<li>Clone a nand.bin from one Wii to install to a different Wii using
Punetwiin; output is also automatically checked by nandBinCheck</li>
<li>Defragment a nand.bin for modest speed improvement and/or to
compensate for new bad blocks in old nand backups</li>
<li>Examples: nand.bin, anything.bin</li>

<li>ModMii supports transferring archives (zip, 7z, rar) both with and
without an /apps/ folder (e.g. usbloader_gx or apps/usbloader_gx). Only
one app per archive can be transferred at a time, and because the HBC’s
managing access is limited to the /apps/ folder any files outside of the
apps folder will be skipped (e.g. roms, games, resources, etc.).
Archives must include a boot.dol or boot.elf file in the app folder (but
not both); other files and subfolders like meta/icon/etc. will get
copied as well.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Wizards &amp; Guides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>New recommended cIOS configuration. Changes have been agreed and
coordinated with wii.guide. A brief rationale for each recommended cIOS
provided below:
<ul>
<li>Slot 248 base 38: only bases 38 &amp; 58 can play SpongeBob’s
Boating Bash, and only 38 has USB keyboard support for Animal
Crossing</li>
<li>Slot 249 base 56: plays majority of games and a few that base 57
cannot; preferred for slot 249 to avoid unnecessary IOS reloads under
USB Loader GX’s Auto IOS setting</li>
<li>Slot 250 base 57: plays majority of games and a few that base 56
cannot</li>
<li>Slot 251 base 58: only bases 38 &amp; 58 can play SpongeBob’s
Boating Bash, and only 58 supports the LAN adapter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All wizards now use YAWM ModMii Edition (yawmME) instead of MMM and
Some YAWMM Mod. Now all functions support Wii motion+ remotes and/or do
not require manually changing SD:/boot.elf/dol in between guide
steps.</li>
<li>Guides will have users install Priiloader before installing WADs
even if a new System Menu is being installed since yawmME is able to
retain Priiloader installations. The only exception is in SysCheck
Updater guides where a custom system menu version is detected or the HBC
IOS (IOS58) is missing/patched, as the Priiloader Installer will refuse
to run without a clean HBC IOS and system menu version.</li>
<li>Removed step to reinstall the HBC with the HackMii Installer to use
IOS58 (where it was included). This step is no longer necessary as the
HBC is now updated as part of the Install WADs step.</li>
<li>Relevant guides now include a section on checking the Hard drive
partition style and converting from GPT to MBR if applicable.</li>
<li>Wizards no longer ask users to select a USB format type (e.g. FAT32,
NTFS, etc.). Instead, applicable guides include all format options in
spoilers along with pros and cons for each.
<ul>
<li>In addition to FAT32 (default/recommended), NTFS and FAT32+NTFS,
directions for two new format types have been added: WBFS and
FAT32+WBFS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Partition style and format type information is included in guides
for devices that were connected when the guide was generated.</li>
<li>Nkit Processing App, GameCube Backup Manager and CleanRip are now
also downloaded when setting up a USB-Loader and referenced in
applicable guides.</li>
<li>System Menu 4.3 is now recommended instead of 4.1 if &lt;=4.0. If
starting on 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 the recommendation is still not change
System Menu versions. There is no benefit to 4.3 over 4.1, but some
users feel strongly about seeing the latest number and their message has
been heard.</li>
<li>Added IOS59 to active IOS download list for Japanese console only as
it is a JPN exclusive IOS. ModMii Wizards will only direct Japanese
consoles to install it.</li>
<li>All Youtube videos were either re-recorded or upscaled and a number
of new videos were created to support guide changes (e.g. YAWM ModMii
Edition).</li>
<li>Enhanced exploit descriptions to list supported firmwares and other
requirements.</li>
<li>Updated DNS servers for str2hax exploit directions.</li>
<li>Wii Channels no longer supported by Nintendo (e.g. News, Wii Speak,
etc.) have been removed from wizards (still available via ModMii’s
Download Pages). These channels can be brought back to life using the
RiiConnect24 Patcher (now also available via ModMii’s Download
Pages).</li>
</ul>
<h3>SysCheck Updater:</h3>
<ul>
<li>SysCheck Updater will direct users to install a base 56 cIOS in slot
249 and base 57 in slot 250; previously both this and the reverse were
considered acceptable. Base 56 is slightly preferred over base 57 for
slot 249 to avoid unnecessary IOS reloads under USB Loader GX’s Auto IOS
setting. This change has also been coordinated with wii.guide.</li>
<li>d2x v10 beta 52 and v8-final are still considered equal to one
another; however, both are considered inferior to v11 beta 1 by ModMii’s
SysCheck Updater even though the improvements can be argued as
relatively minor.</li>
<li>Added optional step to carefully stub or erase unnecessary IOS slots
that should be empty using stub IOS WADs. Stub IOS WADs are never built
for critical or commonly used IOS slots (e.g. 80, 202, 222-224, 236,
240-256, etc).</li>
<li>Any version of the HBC equal to or greater than 1.1.2 is considered
to be up to date.</li>
<li>Custom system menu versions (e.g. v65535) are now detected and users
directed to install stock system menu versions. Custom system menu
versions do not play nicely with Priiloader and/or system menu
hacks.</li>
<li>Region mismatches are now detected (i.e. due to an incomplete region
change) and users are advised to complete the Region Change Wizard to
correct it before proceeding with the SysCheck Updater.</li>
<li>SysCheck Updater guides will now hide the last four digits of the
console ID.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Interface:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slight changes to icons used by ModMii and the ModMii Installer.
ModMii Skin icon is now a different colour.</li>
<li>Added new option to ModMii Skin to change its theme. Anyone at any
time can create a new theme and submit it to XFlak to share with all
users.</li>
<li>Default ModMii Skin theme changed to AuroraNemoia’s Nebula theme.
Original theme still available via ModMii Skin’s theme selector
option.</li>
<li>Added ModMii Launchpad Toolbar and ModMii Context Menu (Right-click)
options; see Drag and Drop changes for more info.</li>
<li>Adjustments to main menu order and wording to be more clear and user
friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downloads / App Updates:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete GUI redesign of ModMii Classic Download Pages (excluding
Advanced Downloads Page).</p>
<ul>
<li>GUI interface with helpful tool tips displayed when hovering your
mouse over items.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Re)introduced auto-updating and semi-auto-updating downloads to
many Wii Apps and PC Programs that still frequently receive updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added an option for Auto-Updating downloads to skip update check if
previously downloaded and cached; disabled by default.</li>
<li>Downloads that are not auto-updating can now be refreshed during
update checks without requiring a full ModMii update. Database (DB)
version/date information is listed in guides as well as ModMii Classic’s
main menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Added support to create custom v14 SD/USB Forwarder dols; v12
still available just in case.</p>
<ul>
<li>ModMii’s USBLoader Forwarder channel was updated from v12 to v14.
Also it now includes a forwarder dol to more easily autoboot this
channel directly from Priiloader. ModMii guides provide general
direction on how to install and autoboot files in Priiloader.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>PC Program Start Menu shortcuts (optional) are now all organized
in a ModMii Start Menu folder instead of a separate folder for each
program.</p></li>
<li><p>If PC Programs are installed portably they will now be saved to
Device:/Program Files/AppName instead of Device:/AppName.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjusted naming convention for advanced user defined downloads to
support some Wii apps not directly used by ModMii (e.g. cIOS installers)
that expect this naming format to work without WiFi
(e.g. IOS56-64-v5661.wad instead of IOS56v5661.wad).</p></li>
<li><p>Bundled new download queue “d2x_installer_bases_38_56_57_58” that
will save d2x base IOSs in the right locations for the d2x cIOS
installer (Wii app) to be able to work offline. The d2x cIOS Installer
is not used by ModMii as it’s redundant, but should users prefer it, it
is downloadable via the OSC or HBB.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed old/outdated Priiloader hacks.ini download, Dop-Mii, and
WiiMod.</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Downloads:</p>
<ul>
<li>YAWM ModMii Edition (aka: yawmME, Yet Another WAD Manager ModMii
Edition) replaced Some YAWMM Mod on ModMii’s Download Page 2. yawmME has
many improvements over its predecessor, including the ability to retain
Priiloader when installing a new System Menu, to launch apps, to
temporarily disable region checks/protection to permit region changing,
and more. Find the complete yawmME changelog on github for the complete
list of changes.</li>
<li>SysCheck ModMii Edition (aka: SysCheck ME) replaced SysCheck HDE on
ModMii’s Download Page 2. Notably, with this update SysCheck.csv logs

<li>d2x cIOS default updated to v11 beta 1
<ul>
<li>More d2x cIOS versions have been added to the options
(e.g. v11-beta1-fakemote0.5.0 for DualShock3/4 USB controller support);
new additions were released prior to this update.</li>
</ul></li>

such as: Remove Deflicker, Block Disc Autoboot, Allow TitleID
RAAE/408x/410x, Remove IOS16 Disc Error, and Mark Network Con as Tested.
Notably the Remove Deflicker system menu hack disables the blurring
filter on 480i and 480p originally meant to prevent “flickering” on CRTs
in interlaced modes. Download was refreshed silently before this ModMii
update.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>WiiSX changed to WiiSXRX (PS1 Emulator): auto-updating from
oscwii.org</li>
<li>SaveGame Manager GX: auto-updating from oscwii.org</li>
<li>WiiXplorer: auto-updating from oscwii.org</li>
<li>Cheat Codes (auto-updating) now downloaded in a single archive
instead of individually and is much faster. The archive is updated
periodically with new cheats from both codes.rc24.xyz and
gamehacking.org.
<ul>
<li>Old/slower Cheat Codes downloader is still accessible via ModMii’s
bundled download queue “CheatCodes_For_AccioHacks”. Use this only if you
require cheat codes to be named in AccioHacks compatible format. The old
downloader is faster than it was in v6.6.3 but still time
consuming.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Any Region Changer ModMii Edition (ARCME) updated to v1.0.6.
Download was refreshed silently before this ModMii update.</li>

http://ccs.cdn.sho.rc24.xyz/ccs/download</li>
<li>Slight change to patched system menu IOSs based on IOS60. TMD was
updated at offset 0x3E2 from 0x0001 to 0x8001 to indicate shared content
in order to save nand space when multiple IOSs with same content are
installed. No functional difference other than saving nand space.</li>
<li>All CSM themes from ModMii’s Download Page 3 are now signed to avoid
unnecessary warning prompts when being installed by MyMenuifyMod after
its 2023 update.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A custom uninstaller is now bundled with ModMii allowing you to
uninstall some or all of ModMii’s components (e.g. you can uninstall Wii
Backup Manager while retaining ModMii, or vice versa, etc.).</li>
<li>App Updater: new feature added to File Cleanup function on main
menu. Users now prompted if they want to check for updates to
auto-updating apps detected on the device (excluding Dolphin and OSC),
or to delete unnecessary files, or both. Latest versions will be
retrieved even if the option to skip update check for Auto-Updating
downloads is enabled. All actions continue to be listed onscreen for
users to confirm before proceeding with changes.</li>
<li>File Cleanup function updated to check for a few more apps to remove
(e.g. HBB) and if a bootmii folder is detected it will be renamed to
bootmii_off to prevent it from being accessed.</li>
<li>Updated bundled version of NUS Downloader Command Line from v0.2 to
v0.6. The old NUSD did not perfectly create TMDs. Imperfect TMDs were
not generally problematic and have been used without issues for many
years. However, the new YAWM ModMii Edition will prevent installation of
any WAD that is not perfect for security reasons. As a result, many of
the WADs in ModMii’s temp folder from older versions will be deemed
invalid going forward and will be automatically re-downloaded. To
correct the files in your temp folder all at once, download the items
from the bundled “NUS_2023_Changes” download queue.</li>
<li>When loading a download queue via ModMii Classic a saved queue can
now be deleted by entering a minus sign in front of the number
(e.g. entering -1 will delete queue # 1). Previously queues could only
be deleted by manually removing them from the temp/DownloadQueues
folders.</li>
<li>The Open Homebrew Channel can be installed to emulated NANDs using
ModMii’s Emulated NAND Builder or Modifier.</li>
<li>Removed option to keep a patched IOS36.</li>
<li>Added red font.bin option for SNEEK/UNEEK in addition to black
(default) and white. Also clarified font.bin descriptions: White text on
Black background (formerly black), Black text on White background
(formerly white) and Red text on Black background.</li>
<li>ModMii verbose option adjusted; now only impacts ModMii Skin and
nandBinCheck but not wget (i.e. wget will always start minimized).
Option can now also be toggled within ModMii Skin.</li>
<li>Minor changes to the ModMii Installer. ModMii Classic will be
launched instead of ModMii Skin after installation. Added Start Menu
shortcuts to website and ModMii installation directory. Updated graphics
to match the new default ModMii Skin theme.</li>
<li>Updated .NET Framework 3.5 installer for newer versions of Windows;
only downloaded if detected as missing.</li>
<li>Improved support for custom paths with special characters like &amp;
and ^.</li>
<li>ModMii will now work even if run from a network location without an
assigned drive letter. The location will be temporarily mapped to a new
drive letter which will get removed when ModMii is cleanly exited. Note
that if ModMii is forcefully closed the new mapped drive will not get
removed automatically, and if done repeatedly it could result in
duplicate mapped drive letters. Habitually running ModMii from a network
location is not advised.</li>
<li>Added some more Easter Eggs to ModMii Classic. Happy hunting!</li>
<li>Other minor changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bugfix:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in ModMii Skin where downloads would fail if the download
path was set to the root of a drive. ModMii Classic never had this
issue.</li>
<li>Updated supporting apps (nusd v0.2, nusfilegrabber and libwiisharp)
with new NUS endpoint used by 3ds and WiiU so they could continue to
retrieve Wii files when NUS was offline from 2022/3/16 to 2022/7/6.
Autopatcher previously released to hotfix this for older versions of
ModMii.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where ModMii Skin would fail if entering S to skip
entering a Mac Address for Wilbrand (i.e. to use Letterbomb).</li>
<li>Fixed issue where ModMii Skin was sending a blank “MAC:” argument
command to ModMii Classic when a &lt;2.2 system menu version was
selected. MAC only required if using the Wilbrand exploit on 4.3.</li>
<li>If an invalid neek “Rev:#” command line argument is sent to ModMii
it will now build the latest version instead of exiting.</li>
<li>Fixed detection of nswitch channel on emulated nands when running
ModMii’s EmuNAND modifier.</li>
<li>Updated various dead links, including link for hypatia. Previously
users without hypatia (hy.exe) cached to their temp folder would be
warned about lack of free space when using ModMii’s Game Bulk Extractor.
ModMii allowed users to continue anyway but now free space estimates are
working again.</li>
<li>font.bin now also included when building non +di variants of neek2o
in order to access the overlay menu. Previously only included for +di
variants.</li>
<li>Fixed bug when dragging and dropping a HDD or SD device onto ModMii
to quickly access its File Cleanup feature.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in v12 forwarder dol builder that limited path length to
204 characters instead of 255.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where SysCheck guides did not include a copy of the
supplied SysCheck if the download location was set as an absolute path
and not a relative path.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in ModMii’s d2x option where users could choose from just
10 d2x versions instead of full list of alternate d2x versions.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Wii might self-destruct in 2023 according to
<a
href="https://hard-drive.net/nintendo-announces-all-still-functioning-wiis-will-self-destruct-in-2023/" target="_blank">some
news outlets</a>.</li>

<h2 id="6.6.3"><a href="#6.6.3">6.6.3 Changelog - 2021:04-23:</a></h2>
<a href="https://github.com/modmii/modmii.github.io/releases/tag/6.6.3" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/modmii/modmii.github.io/6.6.3/total?label=downloads&logo=github" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>Fixed bug where the MMM's boot.elf was not being saved to SD root when appropriate (i.e. for HackMii Solutions Wizard, and for modding virgin Korean Wii's running system menu 4.2 or lower). This only occurred if MMM was not already saved to the SD card before downloading the HackMii Installer, and ModMii would fix itself if downloads were repeated. This bug was introduced when downloads were alphabetized and MMM became queued after the Hackmii Installer instead of before.
<li>Syscheck Updater now also accepts "hermes-v5.1" as a valid info tag for cIOS 202 & 224 (in addition to hermesrodries-v5.1, hermesrodries-v6 & hermesrodries-5.1). These are all the same cIOS but the info signature differs based on the installer used.
<li>Korean consoles now use v1.0 of the Photo Channel, since it has been reported that v1.1 does not work properly on Korean consoles.
<li>Other minor changes.
<br>

<h2 id="6.6.2"><a href="#6.6.2">6.6.2 Changelog - 2021:04-06:</a></h2>

<li>Added multi-language support for analyzing syscheck.csv logs (English, German, French, Spanish & Italian).
<li>NAND backups are now included in syscheck updater guides when updating the HBC or Bootmii.
<li>Improvements to syscheck updater guide based on the version of the HBC currently installed:
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>If the HBC/Bootmii needs to be updated, and IOS58 is already installed, updating the HBC is the first step.
	<li>If the HBC/Bootmii needs to be updated, and IOS58 is not already installed, ModMii will have you update this AFTER the install WADs (or Priiloader) step in order to have the HBC reinstall to use IOS58.
	<li>If the HBC is super old (older than v1.0.7), updating the HBC is the first step in order to gain ahbprot\no-ios-reload support, then ONLY if IOS58 was not already installed according to the syscheck the HBC is reinstalled after the install Wads (or Priiloader) step in order to have the HBC reinstall to use IOS58.
	</ul>
<li>ModMii now detects if it's missing write access to the installation folder, and only if necessary, prompts you to either change the installation directory or press any key to re-launch itself as admin. When relaunching itself, if the standard ModMii shortcuts are detected, they will also be updated to launch ModMii as admin in the future.
<li>Added write permissions check for SD and USB directory settings.

<h2 id="6.6.0"><a href="#6.6.0">6.6.0 Changelog - 2021:02-28:</a></h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<li>New\updated website, exploits, recommended cIOSs, System Menu IOSs, apps, modding steps, videos, discord server and donations page.
<li>Major improvements to ModMii's custom generated guides, updates to many of ModMii's downloads, and fixed a handful of broken links.
<br>
<h3>General</h3>
<li>Updated links to ModMii's new site; modmii.github.io and migrated the project from sourceforge to github.
<li>Added str2hax exploit to ModMii, enabling you to softmod using a FAT32 HDD in place of an SD Card to do most things. This is always included as an exploit option in all of ModMii's guides.
<li>Rewrote ModMii's updater to be able to adapt to potential website changes. Updates should work even if github goes down or ModMii moves to a different home for some other reason.
<li>ModMii's File Cleanup feature now also removes the Priiloader Launcher (new) and ModMii Guides.
<li>Added a dedicated "Extra Brick Protection" setting to Options menu. Previously it had a shared setting with "Update IOSs".
<li>Added d2x version selector to the main Options menu in addition to Download Page 4 and Advanced Downloads Page.
<li>Added hermes cIOS setting to Options menu; when enabled 202 & 222-224 are included in recommended cIOSs. Default is disabled since they are generally redundant with other recommended cIOSs
<li>Added a check to prevent creating dead-end shortcuts if PC Apps are not downloaded successfully.
<li>Created a new ModMii Discord Support Server for users who prefer to use Discord instead of email or gbatemp: https://discord.gg/cMnBRACQwQ
<li>Donations now accepted (again) at modmii.github.io/donations.html. No easter eggs or perks given in exchange for donations. Support is given freely and equally.
<br>

<h3>CIOS</h3>
<li>Updated default version of d2x from v8-final to v10-beta52 and rev number maxxed out to 65535.
<li>ModMii and wii.guide have coordinated updating our recommended cIOSs to install d2x cIOS with base 38 to slot 251. Previously ModMii didn't install anything to this slot, and wii.guide recommended base 58 to this slot. There are 2 games that are supported by d2x base 38 that do not fully work with the standard d2x base 57 & 56 setup in slots 249 & 250. Wii.guide previously recommended installing d2x base 58 to slot 251, but this only worked for 1 of these games. Similarly ModMii previously recommended Hermes cIOSs by default which worked in these cases. Today I am proud to say that these two great Wii modding resources are fully aligned in their recommended cIOS setup. More info here: https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/Wii_cIOS_base_Compatibility_List
<li>Made three new changes to the patched IOS60v6174 that ModMii installs to System Menu IOS slots; 1) tagged 00000000.app for better sysCheck IOS detection; 2) changed version number from 16174 to 65535 since it is no longer needed for sysCheck IOS detection; and 3) replaced Nintendo's RSA Public key with RC24's enabling it to support RiiConnect24, including Wii Mail. With this System Menu IOS you can use RiiConnect24 without having to be on SM4.3. Note that for full RiiConnect24 functionality you will still need to use the RiiConnect24 patcher, but you can skip updating to 4.3 and installing RC24's IOS80 (which carries some small 003 brick potential). ModMii's sysCheck updater will accept both the current and previous versions as being up to date since these changes are non-vital improvements.
<li>Hermes cIOSs 202 & 222-234 are no longer included in recommended cIOSs by default since they are generally redundant with other recommended cIOSs. This can be re-enabled in ModMii's Options.
<li>Adjusted the tag on the IOS236 WAD from Download Page 1 so that it reports the same detailed info in sysCheck logs as the version installed by the IOS236 Installer homebrew. This WAD is still not used in any ModMii functions, but it remains available for download.
<br>


<h3>Wizards/Guides</h3>
<li>Removed IOS236 installation from main modding procedure; instead Priiloader and WADs are installed using ahbprot access. IOS236 WAD, IOS236 installer and Simple IOS Patcher still available in Download Pages.
<li>Replaced MMM with Some YAWMM Mod for ModMii's main wizard and sysCheck Updater wizard as it has support for Motion+ controllers. WiiMod Lite is not supported because of reasons identified here: https://tiny.cc/0ihotz
<li>MMM is still used in some guides where it's launched directly from an exploit to install WADs then use it's App Launcher to load the next app without having to rename files and repeat an exploit. Notes added to these guides on how to proceed you only have Motion+ remotes.
<li>Bundled a new stand-alone script saved to ModMii's Support folder: ExploitAppSelector.bat. It does exactly what it says and works when saved to the root of any SD or COPY_TO_SD folder, or ModMii's main\support folders. ModMii wizards that launch MMM via an exploit also save this script to COPY_TO_SD and reference it in guides to help users change the app launched by exploits.
<li>Added a new first step to guides to explicitly check the format of your SD card (or HDD) and to format it as FAT32 if necessary. Not applicable to Region Change Guides and sysCheck Updater guides as these users will already have done this. These steps were already present in ModMii's USB-Loader setup guides.
<li>In the ModMii main wizard, if a user indicates his wii is not a virgin and knows specifically what he wants to update, and they decide to change SM versions but say no to installing Priiloader, ModMii will override this poor decision and include Priiloader in its guide. I don't think many people are using ModMii this way, but just in case.
<li>Added KoreanKii to region change guides as an optional step to add or remove the Korean Key.
<li>Updated many gifs used in ModMii guides as well as created new ones for ModMii's new videos.
<li>Nintendont is now downloaded as a Gamecube "plugin" when setting up a USB-Loader with one of ModMii's wizards. All apps still available on a stand-alone basis in classic download pages.
<li>Major improvements to the content and formatting of ModMii's custom guides. "Fun Facts" and other pro-tips were added in an attempt to help first-time modders learn more about what they're doing instead of just following steps.
<li>Added support for the LetterBomb exploit to ModMii's guides. This was essentially already supported in the form of Wilbrand's Mailbox Bomb. However, now when ModMii prompts users for their Wii's MAC Address they will be given the option to skip this for now and enter it later. Wilbrand's Mailbox Bomb is constructed if a MAC address is provided; but if skipped, ModMii will not prepare the exploit directly but instead instruct users to download and save LetterBomb to their SD Card. If on SM4.3, LetterBomb is always set to be a secondary exploit option.
<li>SysCheck Updater guides now include a copy of the original sysCheck in a spoiler.
<li>Alphabetized WADs in ModMii's guides as well as downloads in general.
<br>


<h3>App Updates</h3>
<li>Priiloader updated to v0.9 with lots of new features; ModMii bundles it with the Priiloader Launcher app and a modified hacks_hash with the "Lock System Menu with Black Screen" hack removed. Added some important info and warnings to meta.xml; e.g. how to access Priiloader, how it can be removed when updating or (un)installing a new System Menu, name changed to "Priiloader Installer", etc.
<li>Reordered paths for USB-Loader Forwarder Channel to prioritize USBLoaderGX first, WiiFlow second, and CFG third. Also the removed splash screen to speed up load time.
<li>Updated Any Region Changer (ARC) to ARC ModMii Edition (ARCME) by scooby74029; if ARCME detects a region mismatch, you only have to select the "Auto Fix Settings" to correct it. Older versions of ARC required you to set a Region, save, then change the video mode back to it's previous setting, and save again. ARCME's "Auto Fix Settings" takes care of all that (i.e. it does not change the video mode but changes everything else to align with the installed System Menu region). It's a minor improvement over the original but don't forget it also supports Motion+ remotes so ARCME FTW!
<li>Updated USBLoaderGX to blackb0x's r1272 mod v5 released in Feb 2021. It's changelog is quite impressive, you should read it: https://tiny.cc/gxenhanced
<li>Updated WiiFlow Lite to Fledge68's v5.4.8
<li>Updated Nintendont to v6.490.
<li>Updated Wii64 beta 1.1 to beta 1.2; which was released 3 years ago, sorry for missing it! Please report if you notice something like this!
<li>Updated Savegame Manager GX to rev76 by Dj_Skual.
<li>Updated Homebrew Browser from v0.3.9c to v0.3.9e.
<li>Updated sysCheck to the latest, slightly modified, version of sysCheck HDE. The only change is an updated URL to re-enable uploading of reports; thanks to the RC24 team for maintaining this functionality!
<li>Two versions of Bootmii SD Files are now considered valid. The older version hosted online by Team Twiizer, and now also the newer version that the latest HackMii Installer creates when preparing an SD card.
<li>Added custom meta.xml and icon.png to the HackMii Installer. The installer itself is still downloaded from the original source and NOT mirrored.
<li>Updated Configurable USB Loader MOD Patched to the latest version 70r78.11 by nitro from 2017/01/15 (mighty.dol plugin also updated) https://tiny.cc/r5kqtz
<li>CFG USBLoader downloads will only update\overwrite apps folder, existing usb-loader config files will not be overwritten. Previous behaviour would have renamed the usb-folder if detected; now it just skips any duplicates when copying config files.
<li>No longer creates a custom CFG USBLoader config.txt to avoid potential user error\overwrite if manually copying files over to SD or USB.
<br>


<h3>SysCheck Updater</h3>
<li>d2x v8-final and v10-beta52 are considered equivalent by ModMii's sysCheck updater.
<li>SysCheck updater will now consider cIOSs valid regardless of their installed version number (i.e. d2x v10 will be considered valid if it's v65535, v21010 or some other number).
<li>Added check for RiiConnect24's IOS31 to ModMii's sysCheck Updater, if detected users will be prompted whether they want to keep or overwrite RiiConnect24.
<li>Added check to sysCheck updater to abort if console type is detected as vWii
<br>


<h3>SNEEK</h3>
<li>Added checks for SNEEK when building UNEEK, and vice versa. Users are prompted if there's a conflict to choose whether to skip or overwrite SD files for one with the other. This is especially helpful for users trying to set up a SNEEK and UNEEK dual-boot configuration. Users are instructed how to have both SNEEK and UNEEK (with or without DI) set up simultaneously to allow quickly switching between them using USBLoaderGX.
<li>Added many more SNEEK notes to help users get started, and notes are now also displayed if using ModMii Skin.
<br>


<h3>Videos</h3>
<li>9 new or updated videos added to ModMii guides (although the KoreanKii videos are so short they almost don't count)
<li>str2hax and Priiloader v0.9 videos by Foxlet and directed by XFlak.
<li>Some YAWMM Mod, ARCME, KoreanKii removal videos recorded by Clutz450, edited by alexander1970 and directed by XFlak.
<li>KoreanKii installation video by JoostinOnline.
<li>LetterBomb and Downloading LetterBomb videos by DeadlyFoez. He recorded these ages ago but they were never used until now.
<li>Updated HackMii Installer video recorded by Foxlet, combined with older footage from DeadlyFoez, edited by alexander1970, directed by XFlak. This video now shows what the installer looks like if you can install Bootmii as boot2 as well as if you cannot.
<br>


<h3>Fixed dead links</h3>
<li>Updated ModMii's cheat code downloader to use codes.rc24.xyz since geckocodes.org has shut down.
<li>Updated broken links for Accio Hacks, FAT32 GUI Formatter and UnRAR (UnRAR required for SNEEK installations). Broken links were only problematic if the files had not been previously downloaded and saved to ModMii's temp folder.
<li>If you happen to type "scam" after typing "skip" and accidentally press enter at the scam warning screen, ModMii will no longer prompt you with the aforementioned screen until the next software update. Yes I know this isn't a dead link, but if you made it this far into the changelog and are still paying attention you earned an egg!
<li>Reuploaded and updated links for ModMii's youtube videos.
<br>

<li>Bugfix for WiiFlow download.</li>

<li>What was supposed to be my final ModMii update didn't even last a full day. As such, I dub this ModMii update version "Final For Now".</li>

<br>


<h2 id="6.2.0"><a href="#6.2.0">6.2.0 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>Added IOS62 to Active IOS downloads.</li>

<li>Updated ModMii's Shop Channel download to v21.</li>

<li>Added support for new neek2o revs with separate di modules for SD\USB (i.e. dimodule-usb.elf and dimodule-sd.elf)</li>

<li>Postloader forwarder updated from v3 to v4</li>

<li>MyMenuify Mod updated from v1.4 to v1.5</li>

<li>Updated WiiFlow download to grab the most recent version hosted here: https://code.google.com/p/wiiflow/downloads/list</li>

<li>Replaced Joyflow with WiiFlow because WiiFlow can now run via an emulated NAND and JoyFlow is no longer being developed. Also replaced JoyFlow forwarder with WiiFlow v14b forwarder.</li>

<li>Added instructions for users to manually save DML (or Dios Mios) WADs to temp\DML so ModMii can find them. Also disabled ModMii's ability to automatically download versions hosted online because the DML devs keep changing how\where there files are saved and I do not want to mirror their downloads elsewhere.</li>

<li>This update is most likely going to be the last ModMii update. There'll probably only ever be another update if there's a bug, another nintendo update, a bug-free alternative for MMM with wiimote+ support, or if an old friend asks me for a favour. This project has been a lot of fun for me; I've learned a lot and made a lot of friends along the way that will last a lifetime. I want to thank everyone for their support during this crazy adventure, I will truly cherish every minute of it. And while I won't be actively working on ModMii anymore, I don't plan on disappearing so I'll still be around to answer questions. Also, you'll hopefully hear more from me when I eventually create my "XFlak" webpage for my other small projects that I've been working on, so keep your eyes peeled for that. And if you're an old friend reading this, even if it's 10 years from now, you should still be able to reach me via my xflak40@hotmail.com email address. Thanks everyone, it's been real.</li>

<br>


<h2 id="6.1.5"><a href="#6.1.5">6.1.5 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>Fixed very rare bug that caused System Menu theme downloads to fail. Bug only affected users running ModMii portably (i.e. not installed to C:) on a PC that had previously run an older version of ModMii (v6.0.2 or older) to also build a System Menu theme. Thanks to Etheboss for reporting the bug.</li>

<li>Some changes made to address the rare ModMii Skin progress bar bug where it would freeze at 100%. The bug was only reported by two users but they were not able to test these changes.</li>

<li>Removed all linkbucks popups from ModMii, ModMii Skin and the ModMii Installer (v6.2).</li>

<li>Easter egg hunt is over because Chuck Norris demands it.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="6.1.4"><a href="#6.1.4">6.1.4 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>Other minor changes.</li>

<h2 id="6.1.0"><a href="#6.1.0">6.1.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Wilbrand exploit is now built properly even for those with Windows date settings not in mm/dd/yyyy format.</li>
<br>


<h2 id="6.1.0"><a href="#6.1.0">6.1.0 Changelog:</a></h2><li>Letterbomb was replaced by Wilbrand. Wilbrand was created by giantpune and he has given ModMii the unique privilege of being the first to use and share Wilbrand. Wilbrand, named after the inventor of TNT, is a discless Wii Message Board exploit, or "bomb" if you will. ModMii users will no longer need to be instructed to manually download the Letterbomb exploit; instead ModMii will prompt users for their Wii's unique MAC address and build the exploit on the fly. Unlike Letterbomb, ModMii will only require a wifi connection the first time it constructs the Wilbrand exploit. ModMii will only build the Wilbrand exploit for 4.3 system menu's; however, Wilbrand is supported on all system menu's from 3.0 to 4.3. The reason ModMii does not offer Wilbrand exploits for system menu's 3.0 - 4.2 is because bannerbomb, another discless exploit, can be used instead and it does not require knowing your Wii's MAC Address. Wilbrand is available on ModMii's Download Page 2 as well as other wizard\guide functions. A big thank you goes out to giantpune for creating Wilbrand and allowing ModMii to share it with the world.</li><li>ModMii's forwarder dol builder and all of ModMii's supported forwarder channels were updated from v11c to v12 and now support 3TB+ hard drives.

<center>ModMii versions 7.0.0 and 7.0.1 from 2012 were all part of an elaborate <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/modmii-for-windows-official-support-topic.207126/page-329#post-4167035">April Fools Joke.</a><br>Later in 2023, v7.0.0 was released for real with a very different changelog.</center><br>
<del>
<li>Corrected an issue that some users were having when updating to ModMii v7.0.0.</li>

<li>Hey Vegeta, what does the internet say about ModMii's download count?</li>

<li>Other minor changes and bugfixes.</li>

<br>


<h2>7.0.0 Changelog:</h2>

<li>The ModMii user interface was totally rewritten in this update and now not only works on Windows but also on Macs and Linux. Note that when ModMii is being run on a Mac or linux System Menu themes are not supported. Big thanks goes out to DeadlyFoez who played a major role in this update.</li>

<li>Chuck Norris doesn't use ModMii, ModMii uses Chuck Norris.</li>

<li>Other minor changes and bugfixes.</li></del>

<br>


<h2 id="6.0.7"><a href="#6.0.7">6.0.7 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>ModMii now uses TMDedit by person66 to patch TMDs for future d2x beta cIOSs. This will allow davebaol to add or remove modules in future cIOSs without requiring further changes made to ModMii in order to support it.</li>

<li>Updated Casper to v0.3, thanks giantpune!</li>

<li>Updated name of WiiFlow to WiiFlow-Mod</li>

<li>ModMii no longer needlessly downloads 00000001.app from IOS60 when using the latest sneek installer v0.7a. This version of the sneek installer is used when building neek2o rev70+ or neek rev186+.</li>

<li>Added check to Casper2Bootmii for the temp\DownloadQueues folder and creates it if it's missing. This will fix errors that some may have encountered if that folder was missing.</li>

<li>Fixed error when saving an advanced cIOS to a download queue when its slot was not changed.</li>

<li>Other minor changes.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="6.0.6"><a href="#6.0.6">6.0.6 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>Changed how ModMii builds d2x cIOSs. It now parses ciosmaps.xml and direcly applies all the patches listed within it. This gives davebaol more flexibility to change the patches made to the existing base IOS modules. This change was necessary to support future d2x v9+ betas.</li>

<li>Updated d2x-beta-md5-updater.bat, mainly used by davebaol to facilitate d2x beta distributions, to be 33% faster.</li>

<li>Added Casper2BootMii.bat to ModMii's Support folder. Users can run this file in order to set up their SD card to be able to load bootmii on virgin Wii's using Casper.</li>

<li>Other Minor Changes.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="6.0.5"><a href="#6.0.5">6.0.5 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>d2x v8-final is now bundled with ModMii instead of v7-final.</li>

<li>Updated ModMii Skin Launcher (by person66). It now includes a 10ms sleep in order to maintain 0 CPU usage even on older computers. This issue was not present for most users, but person66 personally experienced the old ModMiiSkin.exe process using 20%-40% of his CPU.</li>

<li>Updated ModMii's Syscheck Updater to consider homebrew channel installations of v1.0.0 (in addition to v1.1.0) as up to date when running off of IOS58. This change is to compensate for the latest version of syscheck which incorrectly labels HBC v1.1.0 and v1.0.0.</li>

<li>Now when updating ModMii using ModMii Skin the ModMiiSkin process is killed in order to permit updates to ModMiiSkin.exe itself (if applicable).</li>

<li>Fixed bug where ModMii Skin would not operate properly if the drive settings ended with a forward slash or back slash.</li>

<li>Fixed bug where the back button on the SD Card Drive selection page sometimes crashed ModMii Skin.</li>

<li>Other Minor Changes.</li>
<br>


<h2 id="6.0.4"><a href="#6.0.4">6.0.4 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>Updated md5 hash and sysCheck Updater recognition for v1.0 of the HackMii Installer. A big thanks goes out to Team Twiizers for this unexpected update.</li>

<li>settings.exe was updated to v1.1 by obcd (v1.0 by cwstjdenobs). setting.txt's built for an Emulated NAND of one region but based on a different region's serial number will now also be able to establish a wifi connection.</li>

<li>Added an option to change the setting.txt to ModMii's Emulated NAND Modifier. This will allow you to modify an Emulated NAND to be able to establish a wifi connection when running on a different real Wii.</li>

<li>Fixed bug that only occurred when running ModMii Skin on Windows XP and it would not wait for ModMii Classic to finish running before reporting the Download Log. Thanks to person66 for his revisions to ModMii's Launcher (aka shortcut-er).</li>

<li>Fixed bug where drag and drop support did not work when items were dragged into ModMii.bat and ModMiiSkin.bat. This bug did not apply when items were dragged onto ModMii.exe and ModMiiSkin.exe.</li>

<li>Other Minor Changes.</li>
<br>


<h2 id="6.0.3"><a href="#6.0.3">6.0.3 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>DML support fixed. Thanks to the DML team for the major progress they've recently made. If there is anything ModMii can do to support you better please don't hesitate to message me about it.</li>

<li>Removed ModMii's DML debug mode option as it is now redundant.</li>

<li>Updated the cmd line version of theme mii (by scooby74029) to v1.1, System Menu themes are now constructed quicker and random errors are less likely. Thanks scooby!</li>

<li>Fixed a minor bug in ModMii Classic's Options Menu where you could not toggle the play a sound at finish setting. Thanks goes out to JoostinOnline for reporting this bug!</li>

<li>ModMii, it will support you whether you like it or not.</li>

<li>Other Minor Changes.</li>
<br>


<h2 id="6.0.2"><a href="#6.0.2">6.0.2 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>Updated syscheck to v2.1.0.b17 and removed the beta syscheck download as the latest version should work for everyone. Some minor changes were made to ModMii's sysCheck Updater feature to better analyze the latest syscheck logs.</li>

<li>Updated all DarkWii System Menu Themes (CSMs and System Menu WADs) to v2 (updated iplsettings to 4.3, thanks diddy81!). The only noticable change is that 4.3E Emulated NANDs with themes installed for their first boot will now also be able to accept the EULA to use the Shopping channel and WiiConnect24 (other system menu version's never experienced the problem with v1 themes).</li>

<li>Updated the HackMii Installer video included in ModMii's custom guides. Thanks DeadlyFoez!</li>

<li>ModMii, now match making Mii's in time for Valentine's Day!</li>

<li>Other Minor Changes.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="6.0.1"><a href="#6.0.1">6.0.1 Changelog:</a></h2>

<li>Fixed bug where ModMii would behave unexpectedly if there was an "&" symbol in the Path where ModMii was saved.</li>
<li>Other minor changes.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="6.0.0"><a href="#6.0.0">6.0.0 Changelog:</a></h2><li>ModMii now comes bundled with ModMii Skin, a GUI wrapper that uses\requires "ModMii Classic". Not all features of ModMii Classic are supported in ModMii Skin. ModMii Skin supports the following functions: ModMii Wizard, Abstinence Wizard, USB-Loader Setup, HackMii Solutions, Region Change, Load a Download Queue, SNEEK Installation and NAND builder and Options (including updates).</li><li>Hot Keys are also supported in ModMii Skin for that "ModMii Classic" feel. For example, you can switch between ModMii Skin and ModMii Classic by typing "M" at either Main Menu then hitting Enter.</li><li>ModMii Installer updated to v6.0. It is able to install ModMii v6.0.0 and above. It too has a "Skin" and gives you the option of making shortcuts to ModMii or ModMii Skin on the Desktop and\or the Start Menu. Older versions of the installer will install ModMii v5.5.2, then it will automatically run ModMii after installation and prompt you to update to the most recent version.</li><li>wizapp.exe is now bundled with ModMii and the ModMii Installer in order to support Skin Mode.</li><li>Added play sound at finish option and it's enabled by default. If enabled, it will play a success sound when downloads are successful and an error sound if there are errors.

It is now an autoupdating download that will grab the most recent release of WiiFlow.</li><li>Updated how the latest hosted version of postloader is detected to support recent changes that were made to the googlecode webpage.</li><li>Updated md5 of postloader channel forwarder so the updated version isn't considered "invalid".</li><li>You may have noticed reading this changelog somewhere new. ModMii has a new official website, modmii.zzl.org. Some highlights include a support page with links to the official ModMii forum as well as the new official ModMii IRC channel. Thanks goes out to DeadlyFoez who pretty much put the whole thing together by himself. Also thanks to RobGee789 for graphics and CaseyOmah for helping DeadlyFoez out with some html code.</li><li>Big thanks to person66 for updating his script to launch ModMii and ModMii Skin with an icon, arguments and other useful functions. I also want to thank RobGee789 and M3RK for the awesome graphics they made for ModMii Skin.</li><li>No animals were harmed in the making of this skin.</li><li>Other minor changes.</li><br>

<h2 id="5.5.2"><a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2 Changelog:</a></h2><li>Made changes to how ModMii checks for and performs updates. ModMii v5.5.2 performs exactly the same as ModMii v5.5.1 except that it will be able to install future updates. Going forward, all versions of ModMii older than v5.5.2 will be updated to v5.5.2 before being able to update further (ie. v5.6.X when released).</li><br>

<h2 id="5.5.1"><a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Fixed bug where ModMii would crash when using the ModMii Wizard if downloading WiiFlow.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where you could not go return to the page prior to inputting your serial number when building an emulated nand for uneek2o or uneek2o+di (bug did not effect Abstinence Wizard).</li>
<li>Reverted WiiFlow on ModMii's Download Page 2 back to r304 at FIX94's request. When his mod if WiiFlow is more stable it will be added back to ModMii as an autoupdating download.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="5.5.0"><a href="#5.5.0">5.5.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Abstinence Wizard added to ModMii's main menu. You can use this Wizard to prepare the necessary files to load NEEK on any Wii even if it has not been modifed. In short, to avoid voiding your warranty (or for other reasons) if you choose to abstain from softmodding your Wii, you can still play your games off a USB HDD by using the Abstinence Wizard. The recent release of giantpune's 'Casper' (available on ModMii's Download Page 2) is what made this wizard possible. Thanks giantpune!</li>
<li>Updated WiiFlow on ModMii's Download Page 2. It is now an autoupdating download that will grab the most recent release of FIX94's feature rich and very stable and Mod of WiiFlow.</li>
<li>Other minor changes.</li>
<br>




<h2 id="5.2.1"><a href="#5.2.1">5.2.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Fixed bug where DML was not downloaded when building an emulated NAND.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="5.2.0"><a href="#5.2.0">5.2.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added a DML rev selector and updated DML build process to support DML rev12+. DML was also moved from Download Page 1 to Download Page 4. I want to extend a big thank you to crediar for continuing to work on DML and addressing the issues that DML was facing when running from bootmii IOS. Your solution to install DML on the real NAND to slot 257 solved a lot of problems and the scene thanks you. I also want to recognize WiiPower who has become increasingly involved in the DML project.</li>
<li>Added an option to build DML with debug\logging mode enabled.</li>
<li>Updated NeoGamma on ModMii's Download Page 2 from R9 beta50 to R9 beta56. This version of NeoGamma is able to use DML to play gamecube game backups from an SD Card without requiring NEEK or an emulated NAND.</li>
<li>Added support to build d2x cIOSs with base IOS60, IOS70 and IOS80.</li>
<li>ModMii's SD\USB Forwarder creator was updated from v11b to v11c. ModMii's other forwarder channels were also updated to v11c.</li>
<li>neek2o rev70+ now uses SNEEKInstallerv0.7a instead of SNEEKInstallerv0.6c.</li>
<li>Now when PC programs are downloaded with local save settings (or possibly Auto) they will be saved to a Program Files folder wherever ModMii is saved instead of always being saved to C:\ModMii\Program Files.</li>
<li>Other minor changes.</li>
<br>


<h2 id="5.1.1"><a href="#5.1.1">5.1.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Fixed bug where ModMii's Emulated NAND Modifier would crash if the neek2o option was disabled.</li>
<li>Bugfix: Forgot to include changelog joke in the last update.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="5.1.0"><a href="#5.1.0">5.1.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added a Region Change Wizard complete with custom guides to the Main Menu. Any Region Changer v1.1b Mod06 Offline was also added to Download Page 2. </li>
<li>Added neek\neek2o rev selector, now users can choose from a list of available versions hosted on googlecode. ModMii's neek installion now use v0.7a of the Sneek Installer when installing versions of neek greater than 185. Older versions of neek and neek2o will continue to use v0.6c of the Sneek Installer for now. </li>
<li>The ModMii Wizard Guides for already modifed Wii's now always asks users if they want to install active IOSs and patched System Menu IOSs. This means that users only wanting to update one thing (eg. Shopping Channel) can build custom guides that ONLY update that one thing. </li>
<li>Added drag and drop support for ModMii Download Queues. Just drag the download queue onto ModMii.exe (or a ModMii shortcut) and ModMii will load it and save a copy to temp\DownloadQueues\.</li>
<li>Added drag and drop support for ModMii's Emulated NAND Modifier. Just drag the folder containing your Emulated NAND onto ModMii.exe (or a ModMii shortcut) and ModMii will load your Emulated NAND and prompt you to select which modifications to make. </li>
<li>Added drag and drop support for ModMii's File Cleanup Feature. Just drag your SD Card (or Copy_to_SD folder) onto ModMii.exe (or a ModMii shortcut) and ModMii will load it and wait for confirmation before proceeding with the File Cleanup. </li>
<li>Added disc-based exploits as an option when running ModMii via command line. Some other minor changes were made to ModMii's command line usage. See ModMii's command line help menu for more info (call "ModMii.exe help" from a cmd window). </li>
<li>Added a work around for a bug in the command line version of Theme Mii when it is running portably. If "TMCL.exe" is running portably (ie. not saved to C:\) it produces different output. If ModMii determines TMCL.exe is saved portably it copies it to C:\ModMii\temp\ before using it. Note that this wasn't a dangerous bug because ModMii was correctly reporting the generated themes as invalid. </li>
<li>Fixed a bug where ModMii's Emulated NAND Modifier sometimes got lost (ie. running in the wrong location) and was unable to locate certain required files. The bug only occured when new WADs were NOT being installed to the Emulated NAND. </li>
<li>Other minor changes.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="5.0.0"><a href="#5.0.0">5.0.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>ModMii's generated guides are no longer text files; instead they are custom html files viewable in your internet browser. Although none of the softmodding steps actually changed, the guides were rebuilt from the ground up. They now include images, videos, credits, a print button and more. DeadlyFoez played a key role in this update not only by helping come up with the idea but also creating the template for ModMii's custom guides and recording almost all of the videos and images they use. Within 1.5 weeks since our initial conversation we were able to collaborate and bring the idea to life in time to release it for Christmas. Working together on this was a truly rewarding and fun experience for both of us and we hope it brings a little "Team Your Mom" XMAS cheer to you this year.</li>
<li>When accessing the credits from the main menu using "CR" it will open a new browser tab instead of displaying the credits in the main ModMii Window. </li>
<li>ModMii Wizard Guides for already modified Wii's to update the HBC or Bootmii no longer include exploits. Instead, if users cannot load the hackmii installer from the HBC, BootMii or a forwarder channel they are instructed to use ModMii's HackMii Solutions Guide instead. </li>
<li>Added videos to the ModMii Wizard to help users determine their system menu version and Homebrew channel version. </li>
<li>When ModMii opens the Letterbomb webpage it also opens a separate panel with an instructional video on finding your MAC address and downloading Letterbomb.</li>
<li>Changed how System Menu Theme youtube videos are previewed.</li>
<li>Added drag and drop support for ModMii's sysCheck Updater. Now when users drag and drop their sysCheck logs onto ModMii.exe (or shortcut) ModMii will immediately analyze the log and display a list of required downloads in order to update the softmod.</li>
<li>Fixed d2x cIOS v7-final detection when using ModMii's sysCheck Updater feature.</li>
<li>Relaxed serial number length restrictions in emulated NAND builder so US users can use their real serial even if it's only 11 digits when building non-US NANDs.</li>
<li>Updated md5 for re-uploaded nSwitch channel (v4.8.2.1 partial update).</li>
<li>ModMii: Now so sexy you'll need a fresh pair of pants.</li>
<li>Other minor changes.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.8.2"><a href="#4.8.2">4.8.2 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Synced ModMii's internal version of d2x v7-final with the revised v7-final on the google code page. No major changes, just "Tagged as d2x-v7".</li>
<li>I think he is a she, and she is changelog. </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.8.1"><a href="#4.8.1">4.8.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added a lot more info to NAND\nandinfo.txt when building\modifying emulated NANDs. Also, now after building\modifying emulated NANDs ModMii will open nandinfo.txt using notepad.</li>
<li>Updated nswitch channel to v1.0 - old versions will be detected and updated by ModMii's Emulated NAND Modifier. With this version of the channel installed it is possible to launch UNEEK and UNEEK+DI without an SD Card.</li>
<li>Updated Priiloader v0.4 to v0.7 neek2o mod in ModMii's emulated NAND builder\Modifier. This version of Priiloader will not freeze when installed to emulated NANDs.</li>
<li>Updated Priiloader Hacks (Download Page 2) to include both hacks.ini and hacks_hash.ini. Both files are copied to emulated NANDs when installing Priiloader.</li>
<li>Enhanced ModMii's Emulated NAND Modifier region\firmware detection by having it read from NAND\content\title.tmd. As a result the Emulated NAND modifier is now able to install\remove Priiloader to\from all firmwares (instead of just 4.1-4.3). However, system menu theme installations are still limited to 4.1-4.3.</li>
<li>Replaced the Homebrew Filter Channel with Postloader when building emulated NANDs. There are now two Postloader downloads on ModMii's Download Page 2, a forwarder channel and an autoupdating download for the app itself.</li>
<li>Changed default NAND folder naming when building new emulated NANDs so that they are also compatible with Postloader. Instead of /nands/nand# now they will be named /nands/pl_eu for euro/pal NANDs, /nands/pl_us for USA NANDs, /nands/pl_jp for JAP NANDs and /nands/pl_kr for Korean NANDS.</li>
<li>Users are once again asked to provide a serial number when building emulated NANDs instead of always using the default serial number. This change was reversed after discovering that if on the first boot of an emulated NAND the serial number is not the same as the real NAND it MAY prevent establishing an internet connection.</li>
<li>d2x cIOSs updated from v6 to v7. The d2x v7 final changelog can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios/source/browse/tags/d2x-v7/data/Changelog.txt Thanks davebaol for all your hard work on this!</li>
<li>Enhanced d2x beta support. Now when accessing the d2x beta menu it will list all the d2x versions hosted on the d2x-google code page as well as identify which are featured at that point in time. These are listed in addition to any 'offline' beta d2x cIOSs you may have manually saved to ModMii's Support\More-cIOSs\ folder.</li>
<li>Added d2x-beta-md5-updater.bat to ModMii's Support folder. This will mainly be used by davebaol to facilitate his construction of d2x beta zip archives that are compatible with both ModMii and the d2x cIOS Installer. With this change all future d2x beta cIOSs will be released simultaneously for both installation methods. On a personal note, it was a pleasure collaborating with davebaol on this.</li>
<li>Reverted back to using MMM, IOS236 Installer and Priiloader v0.7 (236 Mod) instead of WiiMod (with ahbprot) and Priiloader v0.7 (with davebaol's ahbprot bug-fix). This was due to WiiMod harmlessly failing to load in certain uncommon situations. I have prepared an alternate version of ModMii v4.8.1 that still uses WiiMod so anyone interested in helping jskyboo beta test WiiMod please get in touch with jskyboo or myself. WiiMod is still available for download on ModMii's Download Page 2.</li>
<li>Updated Wii Backup Manager to Wii Backup Manager 0.4.5 build 78.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where an older version of SaveGame Manager GX was being downloaded instead of the latest version (this was due to a change in how the files were being hosted on its google code page).</li>
<li>Adjustments made to Syscheck Updater to support additional acceptable SysCheck logs (i.e. MIOS v10, cIOS222 and cIOS223). It will now also check if d2x-beta cIOSs are installed when a d2x beta cIOS is activated (instead of always checking for the d2x version included with ModMii).</li>
<li>Some optimizations when running ModMii in command line mode. Added a command to install an extra folder of WADs to an emulated nand. I don't think anyone is using this feature anyways so this isn't big news.</li>
<li>Celebrities may walk on the red carpet, but ModMii walks on toilet paper because it's the SH*T!</li>
<li>Other minor changes </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.8.0"><a href="#4.8.0">4.8.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>New Feature: Emulated NAND Modifer (See ModMii's SNEEK Menu) You can now use ModMii to modify your existing Emulated NANDs. Add your choice of the following to your Emulated NANDs:     Homebrew Filter Channel, cIOS249v14, DML, NMM, Priiloader,     JoyFlow, Themes, Wii Channels and a custom folder of WADs. The Emulated NAND Modifer is also able to detect and uninstall Priiloader, DML and NMM. It's also able to restore the original Wii Theme to Emulated NANDs. If the neek2o option is disabled you can choose to install switch2uneek to Emulated NANDs. When switch2uneek is not selected ModMii will install the nswitch channel if it's missing from the Emulated NAND. Currently there is not cmd-line mode support for this feature.</li>
<li>SD access option now available for neek2o as well as for the original s\uneek.</li>
<li>nswitch channel installed to all emulated nands except when building the original s\uneek and users have also opted to install switch2uneek.</li>
<li>ModMii now uses a different installer for Priiloader v0.7 which instead of IOS236 uses davebaol's solution to the ahbprot connection issue.</li>
<li>WiiMod is now used instead of MMM in ModMii Guides. MMM is still available via ModMii's Download Page 2.</li>
<li>Removed a step from the softmod process. IOS236 is now installed as part of the Install WADs Step instead of having its own step.</li>
<li>Updated Wii Backup Manager to v0.4.4 build 73. Shortcuts to the 64-bit version will be made on 64-bit PCs.</li>
<li>Updated JoyFlow to v2.3 which supports the original version of neek AND neek2o.</li>
<li>Further modification of Ascii2hex.bat to enhance multi-language support. Thanks to geovalley for his solution to this problem.</li>
<li>Lifted region\firmware restrictions for building emunands with s\uneek+di.</li>
<li>Fixed sysCheck Updater to install a clean IOS58 if it's patched.</li>
<li>Added WiiMod and nswitch channel to Download Page 2.</li>
<li>In Soviet Russia, ModMii programs you!</li>
<li>Other minor changes</li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.7.6"><a href="#4.7.6">4.7.6 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added ONEEK support. ONEEK is a mod of S\UNEEK by OverjoY and his team with many added features including support for wbfs games, multiple emulated nands and more. By default ModMii will build ONEEK but it continues to support the original S\UNEEK and can be activated in ModMii's Options. Note that Switch2Uneek is not an option when building ONEEK as the two apps are not compatible.</li>
<li>Updated Wii Backup Manager to v0.3.8 build 69 and also updated MyMenuifyMod to v1.4.</li>
<li>Fixed harmless bug where a System Menu was not downloaded under uncommon scenarios.</li>
<li>Slightly modified Ascii2hex.bat to support rare cases where the old version would cause ModMii to close unexpectedly. Thanks to geovalley for reporting and solving this problem.</li>
<li>No more stupid changelog jokes... the keyword being "stupid".</li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.7.5"><a href="#4.7.5">4.7.5 Changelog:</a></h2>

<h2 id="4.7.3"><a href="#4.7.3">4.7.3 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added a sysCheck Updater feature. You can supply ModMii with your unique sysCheck.csv log and ModMii will analyze it then notify you which specific softmods you're missing. It will download only the files required to update your softmod as well as build a custom guide for you to follow.</li>
<li>Replaced sysCheckGX on Download Page 2 with sysCheck v2.1.0 b13.</li>
<li>Added dip patch the IOS60's patches. The patched IOS60 is now installed to all system menu slots to protect against 003 bricks. As a result, the ModMii Wizard no longer needs to ask if the Wii has been region changed.</li>
<li>Removed Extra Brick Protection option. Instead extra brick protection is now always installed. This includes installing a patched IOS60 to all system menu IOS slots as well as installing a USB-Loader Forwarder Channel. Also added an option to exclude the USB-Loader Forwarder Channel from the ModMii Wizard.</li>
<li>Added feature to install a secondary custom folder of wads when building emulated NANDs.</li>
<li>When building an emulated NAND ModMii no longer asks users to provide a serial number; instead the default serial number is always used. This change was implemented after discovering that using different serial numbers has no impact on functionality. </li>
<li>Fixed bug where the Photo Channel was not being fully installed to emulated NANDs. Now the initial version of the Photo Channel as well as v1.1 are installed to emulated NANDs. The initial version of the Photo Channel was added to Download Page 1; however it shouldn't be required for anything other than emulated NANDs.</li>
<li>Stopped using IOSkpatch to patch emulated NANDs as it is no longer necessary.</li>
<li>ModMii: now updated more frequently than your wife's wardrobe.</li>
<li>Other minor changes.</li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.7.2"><a href="#4.7.2">4.7.2 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added Command Line Support to ModMii. Now you can send arguments to ModMii via a cmd window (or batch file) to perform a wide variety of functions. For information on using ModMii via cmd line, open a command window where ModMii is saved and type "ModMii Help"; alternatively, you can save that text in a new text document where ModMii is saved (rename it from .txt to .bat) then run it.</li>
<li>When building an emulated NAND if a file is missing or invalid it will now be reported on the final summary page. </li>
<li>Entering nothing on the Download Log page no longer sends non-donators to the credits page again. </li>
<li>Update to ModMii Shortcute-er (by person66) to always run ModMii using cmd.exe even if a different file association is set. </li>
<li>Fixed bug when extracting the full version of configurable usb-loader where all the files in the usb-loader folder were not saved to the appropriate subfolders.</li>

<li>Other minor changes. </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.7.1"><a href="#4.7.1">4.7.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Stopped converting ModMii.bat into an executable; this should prevent false-positive virus detections.</li>
<li>Changed ModMii's folder structure; everything is now organized in a "Support" folder. Additionally, ModMii's NAND builder now loads wads from "temp\wad" instead of "temp\install2sneek".</li>
<li>Added an option to build SNEEK and SNEEK+DI with SD access enabled. The default setting is disabled.</li>
<li>ModMii now uses writecdb.exe by scooby74029 to construct cdb.vff when building emulated NANDs. This reduces the amount of time it takes to boot an emulated NAND for the first time.</li>
<li>Added support to save\load multiple download queues.</li>
<li>Added support for the DarkWii Blue and DarkWii Orange System Menu themes.</li>
<li>Updated the "create custom.md5" feature in ModMii's Options page. Now all files are checksummed instead of just wad\dol\elf\app files. Custom.md5's are also updated with the current "Drive" setting. This is great for advanced users to debug things. For example, DeadlyFoez can now create a custom.md5 using "Copy_to_SD" as his "Drive" setting, then share it with Violator who has "C:" as his "Drive" setting. This will allow Violator to verify he has the exact same set of files as DeadlyFoez.</li>
<li>Instead of bundling Unfreezemii.bat with ModMii, users are instructed to type Ctrl+C then "N" then "Enter" when they encounter long periods of inactivity.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where URL Forwarders were not using the first 4 characters of the URL (ie. "www.hotmail.com" would load "hotmail.com"). Thanks to Winhacker for reporting this problem.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where System Menu themes were not being installed to emulated NANDs.</li>

<li>Updated Wiimm's Wit.exe to support gamecube game bulk extraction in addition to Wii games.</li>
<li>hy.exe and unrar.exe are no longer bundled with ModMii due to a licensing conflict.</li>
<li>Updated to libwiisharp and patchios by scooby74029 to address false-positive virus detection. He also added Version Patch support to patchios.</li>
<li>All patched IOSs now include the Version Patch (including IOS236). The Version patch has been added as an option to the Advanced Downloads section for applicable IOSs.</li>

<li>Changed recommended cIOS 202/222/224 from 202[57]-v5, 222[38]-v5 and 224[57]-v5 to 202[60]-v5.1R, 222[38]-v4 and 224[57]-v5.1R.</li>
<li>Rewrote how cIOSs are signed and patched with the Korean Common Key. The output is the same as before but the new method is a lot faster.</li>
<li>Removed the "Hexedit" option since the new method of signing\patching cIOSs should not be problematic for anyone.</li>

<li>Now pleasing your Wii more than you ever could.</li>

<h2 id="4.6.1"><a href="#4.6.1">4.6.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Fixed bug where under specific circumstances non-d2x cIOSs were sometimes
signed with d2x-beta details. </li>
<li>Warning: May result in tears of joy. </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.6.0"><a href="#4.6.0">4.6.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>ModMii and the ModMii Installer have new icons by WiiShizzza. Thanks to
everyone who submitted a ModMii icon\logo candidate. </li>
<li>d2x cIOSs updated to d2x v6 - "IOS Reload Block: The Ultimate Solution".
</li>
<li>Added support for multiple d2x-beta's. New modules and the d2x-beta.bat
file should now be saved here in order for ModMii v4.6.0+ to use it:
modules\More-cIOSs\{ANY FOLDER NAME}\. Inside the "More-cIOSs" folder u can
save as many d2x-beta folders as you like (ie. "d2x v7 final", "d2x v8
beta1", etc.). Switch between different d2x cIOS beta's by typing "beta" on
download pages containing cIOSs. It will load a menu asking the user to
decide which d2x beta folder to use. The old method of saving new modules
and the d2x-beta.bat file  to modules\d2x-beta\ is still supported. </li>
<li>The Korean Key patch was added to ALL the cIOSs ModMii builds that do
not use IOS38 as base. This will allow non-Korean Wii's to load Korean
games. </li>
<li>All cIOSs ModMii builds are now signed with cIOS details (previously
only d2x cIOSs were signed). Note to developers: merged base IOS37+38 is
signed as base IOS75 (37+38). </li>
<li>Advanced Custom Downloads now support batch downloads instead of being
limited to one advanced download at a time. Advanced downloads can be saved
to download queues. When loading download queue's containing d2x cIOSs,
ModMii will update the queue with the d2x cIOS version information ModMii is
currently set up to construct. For example, if you load a download queue
containing cIOS248[56]-d2x-v6-[v65535], but you have since configured ModMii
to construct d2x v7-beta1 cIOSs, ModMii will automatically update the
download queue to construct cIOS248[56]-d2x-v7-beta1-[v65535]. This means
you can create a download queue containing d2x cIOSs, and re-use the same
download queue even as the d2x cIOSs get updated. </li>
<li>Changed the naming convention for new slot numbers when building
Advanced Custom cIOS Downloads. For example, if the slot was changed to 248,
the WAD will be named cIOS248x instead of cIOS249x-slot248. </li>
<li>Added option to disable hex editing signatures and the Korean Key patch
when building cIOSs. Default setting is enabled, and it should only be
changed in rare cases when a PC cannot Hex Edit cIOSs properly even after
performing windows updates. Warning, if disabled ModMii will not validate
cIOSs but they should still work except loaders will be unable to detect the
version of the installed cIOS and the default option "Block IOS Reload =
AUTO" won't work with Configurable USB-Loader and USB-Loader GX.
Additionally Non-Korean Wii's will not be able to load Korean games. </li>
<li>Added two new settings to option "1"; the four settings are now as
follows: A) Do not Keep 00000001 or NUS Folders for IOSs\MIOSs\SMs etc
(default) B) Keep 00000001 Folder for IOSs\MIOSs\SMs etc (Useful for offline
usage of Wii    Apps like Dop-Mii) C) Keep NUS\00000001000000##v# Folder for
IOSs\MIOSs\SMs etc (Useful for offline    usage of Wii Apps like d2x\Hermes
cIOS Installers) D) Keep NUS\00000001000000##v# and 00000001 Folder for
IOSs\MIOSs\SMs etc </li>
<li>Improved the update check for ModMii and the ModMii Installer. There
should no longer be any lag between the time an update is released and
ModMii detects it. </li>
<li>Priiloader has been updated from v0.4 - 236 Mod to v0.7 - 236 Mod. Note,
Priiloader v0.4 is still the version that is installed to emulated nands for
s\uneek. </li>
<li>Updated the JAP version of the Tales of Symphonia Eri Hakawai Exploit.
It now has 2 game saves to support each of the different versions of the JAP
game and the ModMii guides have been updated accordingly. Thanks giantpune!
</li>
<li>Code clean up, optimization and other minor changes. </li>
<li>ModMii is now compatible with the WiiU. </li>

<h2 id="4.5.7"><a href="#4.5.7">4.5.7 Changelog:</a></h2>

saved to the temp folder in order to build s/uneek. </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.5.6"><a href="#4.5.6">4.5.6 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>All d2x cIOSs (even beta cIOSs) are now signed with descriptive info so
loaders can more efficiently detect what cIOSs are installed. </li>
<li>ModMii now builds s/uneek using the latest compiled modules on the
sneeky-compiler google code webpage. </li>
<li>Modmii can now beat the games you have trouble with! Just sit back and

the Explorer: Dora Saves the Snow Princess. </li>
<li>Other minor changes. </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.5.5"><a href="#4.5.5">4.5.5 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Updated d2x cIOSs from v3 to v4. Warning: WiiFlow currently needs to be
updated in order to use v4 d2x cIOSs to download covers. However, the v4 d2x
cIOSs are already perfectly compatible with Configurable USB-Loader. </li>
<li>After verifying downloads, if a "CUSTOM_COPY_TO_SD" or a
"CUSTOM_COPY_TO_USB" folder is detected where ModMii.exe is saved, users
will have the option to copy the contents of the folder to its respective
device. This is useful for more advanced users who want to customize and
automate how ModMii configures their devices by quickly copying over
additional apps, wads, or other files. </li>
<li>Laughing gas available upon special request. </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.5.4"><a href="#4.5.4">4.5.4 Changelog:</a></h2>

build cMIOS-v4 WiiGator GCBL v0.2 by mistake. </li>

<li>Added switch2uneek and multiple emulated Nand support when building emulated
Nands for uneek/uneek+di. </li>
<li>switch2uneek r7 (by Conanac) updated to r7 Mod1 (Mod by XFlak). It now
loads bootmii @ IOS (IOS254) when launching uneek instead of resetting the
Wii. This allows even Wii's without bootmii @ boot2 to launch directly into
uneek. It was also compiled using newer libraries for greater USB
compatability and stability. </li>
<li>Added option when building emulated nands for uneek/uneek+di to download
JoyFlow and install a JoyFlow forwarder channel to the emulated Nand (and
Priiloader forwarder dol if applicable). </li>

<li>ModMii's emulated NAND builder now gives users the option to install
Priiloader (and hacks.ini) to the emulated NAND. </li>
<li>In order to support JoyFlow naming conventions, ModMii's Sneek Game Bulk
Extractor now extracts games to folders according to their "TITLEID" instead
of TITLE+[TITLEID]. It will automatically rename folders previously saved
under ModMii's old naming convention to the new naming convention. It also
generates a csv file with a numbered list of your games with columns for
Title and Title ID. It also creates a batch file on the root of the hard
drive that users can run by itself at any time to update the list. This will
come in handy to update the game list when copying pre<li>converted games
from one drive to another. </li>
<li>Added a new setting in ModMii's options to set the "PC" Programs Save
Location. Currently only two downloads are effected by this option:
WiiBackupManager and FAT32 GUI Formatter. If this option is set to "Local",
PC apps will be saved to your homedrive (ie. C:) and shortcuts on the Start
Menu and Desktop will be made. If set to "Portable", they will be saved to
portably according to Drive settings. The default setting is "Auto", which
will use "Local" settings if ModMii is installed to the homedrive and
"Portable" settings otherwise. </li>
<li>Added Eri HaKawai Exploit for "Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New
World" for USA\PAL\JAP Wiis. </li>

the bootmii folder ModMii would exit after building the config file but
before downloading the "bootmii" folder. The "bootmii" folder was and still
is also available on download page 2. </li>
<li>ModMii is now able to occupy your girl so you have more free time to
play Wii. </li>

official sneek installer and should work for everyone. </li>
<li>ModMii's Sneek Game Bulk Extractor now only gives a warning if it
detects there isn't enough free space on the target drive. Now users with
uncommon language settings can utilize the Sneek Game Bulk Extractor even if
it incorrectly identifies that the drive doesn't have enough free space.

Red Theme by the Wii Theme Team is the only supported theme on 4.1/4.2/4.3
firmwares of all regions. When using the ModMii Wizard or the NAND Builder,
users will be asked if they want to install a theme or not. </li>
<li>Added offline support to ModMii. A temp folder saves a copy of all
downloads (except Auto-Updating Downloads) so that ModMii will never need to
download the same file twice. The Save Zip option has been replaced by
ModMii's offline support. </li>
<li>ModMii Wizard now recommends users beginning on a 4.3 System Menu remain
on 4.3. ModMii Guides now instruct users to install a patched IOS236 using
either IOS236 Installer or Simple IOS Patcher. Recommended cIOSs now include
cIOS250v20[57] instead of cIOS250v20[38]. </li>
<li>The USB-Loader Set Up guide offers Users the choice to download
Configurable USB-Loader, WiiFlow or both. The latest Official/Full release
of Configurable USB-Loader is now downloaded instead of the latest beta
release. WiiBackupManager is now used to format drives instead of FAT32 GUI
Formatter. </li>
<li>NAND Builder now includes IOS41,43,45,46,48, BC and a Dark Wii Red Theme
option. </li>
<li>"ModMii Updater 1.0" updated to "ModMii Installer v2.0" Can perform
local installations (including shortcuts on desktop\start menu) and it still
offers the traditional portable installation option. This will be the only
download link listed on the ModMii webpage from now on. </li>
<li>Updated NusFileGrabber to v1.3 in order to download various files listed
below. </li>

also performs a check to make sure the Drive-letter exists. </li>
<li>The ModMii Wizard will now ask users currently on 4.3 if they would like
to download active IOSs. Most 4.3 Wii's should not need to update its IOSs
as they should already be up to date. However, if a 4.3 Wii has DarkCorp
installed or has problems playing original games via the Wii System Menu, it
will now be able to update its active IOSs using the ModMii Wizard. </li>
<li>ModMii is now also available in French. The French version will receive
its own unique French updates. French updates will probably lag slightly
behind English updates. Thanks to xav91 and ketufe for doing the majority of

<li>Download Wizard now supports upgrading to 4.3 (but still not recommended).
</li>
<li>Download Wizard now supports non-virgin Jap and Korean 4.3 Wii's (Virgin
4.3 Jap and Korean Wii's are still unsoftmoddable) </li>

entire folder of Games/ISOs to your SNEEK+DI or UNEEK+DI enabled FAT32 Hard
Drive. </li>
<li>File Cleanup feature added to assist those wanting to delete un-needed
files after mod completion. </li>
<li>Bootmii.ini builder/configurator added.  It can build/customize the

of which are required to launch bootmii (these files are also saved to the

the new 'Root Save' Option to Save IOSs\MIOSs to root instead of the WAD
Folder (does NOT affect Download Wizard and only applies to IOSs\MIOSs).
This is useful for Wii Apps that require IOSs\MIOSs saved to Root (also
useful in combination with the option to save the 00000001 folder, as some
Wii apps also require IOSs/MIOSs saved to the 00000001 folder). </li>
<li>When saving Download Queue's, 3 settings now also will be saved to the
queue (Root Save, Keep 00000001 Folder and Save Zip). When this Queue is

what they are and if they differ from your overall settings). </li>

update versions). Stub IOSs have been removed entirely. </li>

accessible from one page to the next, allowing you to add files from
multiple pages to a single Download Queue. </li>
<li>Added more error-reduction checks when building a cIOS. Now the base
wads will also be verified and deleted/re-downloaded if corrupt somehow.
</li>

should fix the update error one user reported having. </li>

Wii's). </li>

<li>Added "Advanced Custom Downloads" feature (and moved User-Defined Custom

"ciosversion=", which is the term used in the Wad Manager config file) </li>
<li>Due to popular demand, I've set up a PayPal account. If you want, you
can send donations via PayPal to xflak40@hotmail.com (just think of what I
could do if I had something better than notepad to program with!). If you do
make a donation, PM me on gbatemp or send me an email (at the same email
address), and as a way of saying thanks, I will reveal one of NUSAD's
functional Easter Eggs to you. </li>

Manager). Based on your answers, it will add some custom lines to the
config.txt file used by configurable USB-Loader. </li>
<li>Added 'on-the-fly error reduction technology'. Files are verified after
they are downloaded, if files are missing or fail MD5 Hash checks, the file
will be deleted (if applicable) and Re-Downloaded. Existing files are now
only Skipped if they are successfully verified, otherwise, they too will be
deleted and Re-Downloaded. Note, that each file will only attempt to be
downloaded 2 times, if it fails MD5 hash checks twice, it will move on to
the next file in the cue (this is to prevent never ending loops in the event
of real changes to files). </li>
<li>Files that used to be hosted on myfail.net (ie. Priiloader hacks.ini)
are now hosted elsewhere. This will solve the 'Priiloader Hacks Missing'
problem. </li>
<li>Updated MD5 hash database (since many files changed after the 4.3
update), this will stop false-positive errors from occurring. </li>
<li>Updated diff files for cIOS creation (for 4.3 NUS hosted file change)
</li>
<li>fvc is now used instead of %folder%sfk to verify downloads (%folder%sfk
was not listing errors when NUSAD is in exe form) </li>
<li>On the Verify/Download Log page, the window size will increase
automatically to fit all the text (removed the +/- options to increase and
decrease window size). Also on this page, added an option to (R)epeat

<h2 id="4.1.4"><a href="#4.1.4">4.1.4 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added an optional "Extra Brick Protection" feature which will protect Wii's
from accidentally changing to a system menu without having the IOS for that
system menu already installed. NUSAD can grab many non-stubbed SM IOSs for
the following system menu IOS slots (11,20,30,40,50,52,60). For system menu
IOSs slots below 40, IOS60v6174-patched is installed in order to protect
LU64+ wii's from using older incompatible IOSs. All of these IOSs have a
version number that is equal to the Stub's version number plus 1 (so they
will survive an official update). The normal IOS30-patched is still
available for download in the batch download page. </li>
<li>Fixed IOS70v54321(IOS60v6174-patched).wad for Korean Wii's, it used to
download IOS70 instead of IOS60v6174, but now it grabs the right IOS. </li>
<li>Removed option to patch system menu IOSs. Now they are always patched
when using the wizard function. Non-patched IOS30, 60 and 70 are now instead
available for download in the "Archived Downloads" page. </li>
<li>Proper handing of stub IOSs in the Download Wizard. Now it will only
download stub IOSs that should be present on your wii's specific firmware
and region (ie. If I am installing SM4.1, it will not download any of the
stubs that were released with v4.2). Stub IOSs for slots 200 and up will not
be downloaded if your wii is either a virgin or you've selected to download
recommended cIOSs. Stubbed System Menu IOSs will not be downloaded if you
answered Yes to Extra Brick Protection. </li>
<li>Fixed Hash check when MMM's boot.dol is saved to the root of the Drive
(ie. "COPY_TO_SD"). This only affected the HackMii Solutions and the
Download Wizard but only for Korean Virgin Wii's (or any Korean Wii
installing the HBC). </li>
<li>Some other minor changes. </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.1.3"><a href="#4.1.3">4.1.3 Changelog:</a></h2>

v4.1.2 only worked on 64 bit systems). Also, now if you get errors, the text
will be in red </li>
<li>Fixed Hash for the Euro News Channel </li>
<li>Renamed "modules" Folder back to "Support" (modules folder no longer
required since fvc.exe was removed) </li>

<li>Uses a newer version of WadMii (cwstjdenobs' 2nd WadMiiIsh mod), it
works exactly the same at the last one, but with some code cleaned up and no
verbose output </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.1.0"><a href="#4.1.0">4.1.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added the ability to create cIOSs and cMIOSs in wad form for easy batch
installation via a wad manager. </li>
Note: that this is done legally, any copyrighted nintendo files are
downloaded from their servers directly. The custom cIOS (or cMIOS) modules
bundled with NUSAD (made by Waninkoko, Hermes and WiiGator) are open source
and legal to share under GPL. The diff files bundled with NUSAD do not
contain any nintendo code, but instead they only store the differences
between the unencrypted base wad modules and the unencrypted cIOS modules
(so it only stores/applies the same changes the cIOS/cMIOS installers make
to the base wad in the first place). All credit for these cIOSs/cMIOSs go to
Waninkoko, Hermes and WiiGator, all I did was reverse engineer their work
and repack it into a wad (which still wasn't easy). Also note that these
cIOS/cMIOS wads work exactly the same as if you were to install the cIOSs
using an official installer -- it has been tested extensively. FYI, I spoke
with Waninkoko and he gave me his consent to do all of this. </li>
<li>Download Wizard and Guide now install cIOSs/cMIOSs using wads, not the
installers. Note that the installers and base wads are still available for
download in batch download page and archived download page. </li>
<li>IOS61 now always downloaded when getting the HackMii Installer via the
Wizard. </li>
<li>The guides now use Multi Manager Mod v13.2 (MMM) instead of YAWMM and
Dop-Mii. Some other optimizations to the guide. </li>
<li>Changed the entire "hackmii solution" option from the main menu, now it
downloads bannerbomb (v1 or v2), the HackMii Installer, MMM, IOS34 and
IOS61, and it will print out a GUIDE for fixing the upside-down homebrew
channel or no vulnerable IOS problems (including methods to fix it if
missing the HBC). </li>
<li>Added the ability to select common groups of files to the batch download
page. </li>
<li>Download confirmation page now automatically extends to fit the amount
of text on screen (so if you have a massive download list, you wont need to
press + or - to expand or shrink the window anymore). </li>
<li>Download Cues can no longer be saved/loaded on the batch download page.
Instead, they can be saved on the download confirmation and download
verification pages (before and after executing a batch download), and they
can be loaded from the main menu (note, the option to load a download_cue
only appears if a download_cue has been saved) </li>
<li>Added the ability to not only save the download_cue (S), but also to add
the new cue to an existing download cue (S+) -- this could come in handy
especially now that I have 3 different download pages. </li>
<li>Added an Archived/Outdated Downloads page to download outdated files
(all Stub IOSs can be downloaded from here) </li>
<li>Hackmii Installer now also saved to SD:/apps/HackMii_Installer/boot.elf
in addition to SD:/boot.elf </li>
<li>Added mmmconfig configurator (for Multi-Manager Mod) </li>
<li>Changed color scheme (modelled after the ever-nostalgic BSOD, lol) </li>
<li>Added scam warning/disclaimer at program start-up (hopefully this will
prevent people from reselling this free application) </li>
<li>Added another functional Easter egg, now there are two functional Easter
Eggs. Don't ask me what they are. </li>
<li>other minor changes </li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.0.1"><a href="#4.0.1">4.0.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>Added an auto-update feature (this can be disabled in the options menu, if
you disable it, I strongly recommend regularly checking for updates manually
on the options page, or this webpage [tinyurl.com/nusauto]). Note that I
will be updating this program with updates for IOSs/apps/cios
installers/guides/etc. as they are released.</li>
<li>Added more download options to the download wizard if you answer your
wii is NOT a virgin (ie. hackmii installer and bannerbomb)
If in the download wizard you answer your wii is NOT a virgin but you want
to download a cIOS Installer, all the base wads will also be downloaded and
saved in the right place (previously only the installer was downloaded--but
it always downloaded base wads in the past if you answered your wii is a
virgin)</li>
<li>Some other minor changes</li>
<br>

<h2 id="4.0"><a href="#4.0">4.0 (aka 3.3beta) Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>added Download wizard with custom guide generator. It can now download apps,
including the hackmii installer using wget. Zip files are extracted using a
command line version of 7zip (7za)</li>
<li>added Wad Manager Configurator (builds custom wm_config.txt files)</li>
<li>No longer uses Enfis_SFV check, instead an md5 hash check is performed
using FSUM</li>
<li>Now included NusFileGrabber 1.1 by Leathl, which now gets 0000000e.app
from IOS70v6687 and 00000001.app from IOS60 v6174 for use with SNEEK. It
also no longer requires the common-key (so makekeybin has been removed from
the supporting exe's)</li>
<li>uses the original version of Leathl's libwiisharp.dll again (new
patchios.exe does not timestamp patched wads, so modified libwiisharp.dll is
no longer needed - this allows for consistent hash checks of the patched
system menu IOSs)</li>
<li>patchios upgraded to v1.1 by Leathl, which does not time-stamp wads
(making consistent hash checks possible), it also is capable of changing the
IOS slot and version number of a wad</li>
<li>Supports upgrading Region Changed Korean Wii's (downloads IOS60, and on
the fly it patches it, changes its slot to 70 and its version to 54321 -
this will prevent 003 errors)</li>
<li>Batch mode, added ability to deselect individual files, select all and
deselect all</li>
<li>Added ability to save and load custom download cues (I got this idea
when gameking66 suggested loading download cue's from the download log)</li>
<li>Added credits page</li>
<li>A lot of other minor changes (I think I covered everything major)</li>
<br>

<h2 id="3.2"><a href="#3.2">3.2 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>system menu IOSs are patched on the fly, this can be disabled in the options
(having a patched system menu IOS has many uses/benefits)</li>
<li>includes a modified version of Leathl's libwiisharp.dll that does not
timestamp patched wads (this allows for consistent hash checks of the
patched system menu IOSs)</li>
<li>settings are loaded differently, now the app will not crash while
loading previously saved settings if the filename has been changed (from
"NUS Auto Downloader.exe")</li>
<li>added a functional Easter egg (don't ask me what it is!)</li>

<h2 id="3.1"><a href="#3.1">3.1 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>fixed bug in batch mode ("S" was the command to mark the Shopping Channel
for install and it was also the command to Start downloading, now the
command for the shopping channel is "SH")</li>
<li>French translation of v3.1 by Corenting is now available</li>
<br>

<h2 id="3.0"><a href="#3.0">3.0 Changelog:</a></h2>
<li>I basically rewrote the whole thing in v3, the source code is finally
organized, so it will be easy for me to update when/if new files become
available in the future.</li>
<li>Most noticeable changes include the Options page and a new activity
which downloads the required files to use the Fakesign Restorer (or trucha
bug restorer).</li>
<li>v3.0 has a lot of new features and I'm not going to explain them all,
check out the pics or play with the program for a better idea of what's new.
I am not going to make a new youtube video as the general usage between v2
and v3 has not changed much.</li>
<li>German translation by MechMK1 should also be available soon</li>
