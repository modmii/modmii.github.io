ModMii is completely free to use, ad free and open source. Any support will help me afford to treat my kids more often or enroll them in more fun activities like swimming lessons and other sports!

It's now easier than ever to donate to ModMii using [Ko-fi (accepts paypal)](https://ko-fi.com/T6T3JYHBO) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/xflak) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/10186747/checkout)!

# Introduction: What is ModMii?

- ModMii is able to download all the files needed to modify ANY Wii, WiiU or vWii; it can generate custom guides based on your console's specifications, and save the files in their appropriate locations for easy offline softmodding where possible. Sample guides for illustrative purposes only are available [HERE](https://modmii.github.io/sampleguides).
- It is also capable of performing many other Wii\vWii hacking functions like setting up a usb-loader and creating an emulated NAND. ModMii was also the very first official installer for the widely adopted d2x cIOS.
- Even if your Wii's SD Card reader is broken or you just don't have an SD Card, you can use a Hard Drive formatted as FAT32 in place of an SD Card to complete the majority of ModMii's functions (SD Card notably required for Bootmii and making a NAND backup). In fact ModMii can help users softmod a Wii even without an SD Card or Hard Drive (as long as it has internet), but unless one or the other is eventually incorporated there probably isn't much point.
- ModMii only works on Windows, and ModMii v8.0.0 and higher requires 64-bit Windows 8.1 or later. If you do not have a Windows PC and are unable to run ModMii you can try running Windows in a virtual machine or just use [wii.hacks.guide](https://wii.hacks.guide/) or [wiiu.hacks.guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/) instead.

The video below describes some of ModMii's many features; however note that it was created before WiiU & vWii support was added in v8.0.0.

### **Credits**
[ModMii](https://modmii.github.io/) was written entirely by yours truly, XFlak. Trust me, no one else is crazy enough to try to maintain a batch file that has grown so large and 'all over the place'. But without the help of many other very talented people ModMii would not exist. Some people have contributed supporting files or programs, others have shared their knowledge, some have provided ideas and others have given their time.

I have tried my best to recognize everyone's contribution to ModMii in the [credits](https://modmii.github.io/credits.html) regardless of how big or small it is. If I've forgotten someone, please notify me and I'll add them to the credits as quickly as possible.

### **About the author:**
ModMii started out as a small side-project back in 2010 as a simple NUS Auto Downloader script, and now the changelog is taller than me! I started this project in my 20's in my spare time and since then I've gotten married and had not 1, not 2, not 3, but FOUR boys, all ~2 years apart (but ModMii will always be my first baby, lol). I love being able to share my love for gaming and for the Wii with them, and with all of you! This is a passion project that has easily taken over 9000-10000 hours of just my time alone, and that's not counting all the hours spent from the legions of devs and testers who've supported ModMii over the years.

Not knowing that much about computers other than some excel tricks, I slowly built more advanced features on top of my original less efficient code that I'd love to rewrite if it wasn't such a daunting task. Throughout the journey I learned a lot from not just those in the credits list, but the incredibly supportive Wii community as a whole. I've gone from just being a "numbers guy" to my family's go to "tech guy", and I have this project, community and followers to thank for it.
